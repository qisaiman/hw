SG and FG experiments remain essentially the same as that of OT growth, except that in SG additional tungsten powders were distributed onto the receiving substrate, and in FG more than one piece of substrate was employed. The modification is schematically illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:wogrowsf}. More details will be provided when it comes to the discussion.

With four kinds of W powders and three layouts, we designed the experimental matrix as illustrated in Table.~\ref{tab:matrix}. The symbol $\times$ means this combination is covered in this work, and NA means otherwise.

We will first present the OT growth results in section~\ref{sec:nawox}, and discuss the other two in section~\ref{sec:sgfg}.

We found the growth using 3N source show distinctive features in comparison to the rest. This mainly arise from the higher sodium concentration in 3N source than that in others. Therefore we focus on 3N source first, and move on to other latter.

An empirical formula to relate the Raman peaks and \ce{W-O} bonding lengths \cite{Hardcastle1995} is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:wobond}
\nu = 25823 \exp{-1.902\cdot R}.
\end{equation}
And the standard deviation of estimating \ce{W-O} bond distance from Raman stretching wavenumber is $\pm0.034$\AA.
The observed Raman peaks of \ce{Na5W_{14}O_{44}} phase lies at 965, 943, 913, 808, 786, 778, 765, 695 and 107 cm. Multi-peaks Lorentzian fitting is preformed to precisely determine the central maximum. Good fitting is obtained, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:naworamfit}. We then calculated \ce{W-O} bond distance using Eq.~\ref{eq:wobond}, as illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:nawobond}. The predicted \ce{W-O} bond length comply very well with the crystallographic value of \ce{Na5W_{14}O_{44}} phase.\cite{Triantafyllou1999a} The 107 peak probably is caused by \ce{Na-O} bond.

Both tungsten (W) and molybdenum (Mo) belong to Group VIB transition metal, with outer shell electrons configuration as $4d^55s^1$ and $5d^46s^2$, respectively. Therefore we refer their oxides and chalcogenides as \gls{tmo} and \gls{tmdc}.\footnote{Obviously transition metals include many other elements, all of which have partially filled $d$-electron shell. But here we use TM to denote W and Mo exclusively.}

Nucleation is a process of generating a new phase from a metastable old phase, where the Gibbs energy per molecule of the bulk of the emerging new phase is less than that of the old phase.

General CVD knowledge, substrate preparation, and\cite{MichealK.Zuraw2003}


The energetic sources are ion bombardment, electron beam, laser ablation, and combustion flame\cite{Rao2011}.

The solâ€“gel process is a well-known, intensively studied wetchemical technique that is widely used in materials synthesis. This method generally starts with a precursor solution (the ``sol") to form discrete particles or a networked gel structure. During the course of gelation (aging process), various forms of hydrolysis and polycondensation take place.
In addition, doped \ce{WO3} was also demonstrated
The composition and phase of final product highly depend on the synthesis conditions.

We do not discuss tungsten oxide hydrates (\ce{WO3.nH2O}) in this work since the product of thermal CVD approach is not plagued with this complexity. It's necessary, however, to deal with hydrated \ce{WO3} in the liquid synthesis routes, as indicated in Section.~\ref{sec:woxgrowth}.


Nonstoichiometric tungsten oxides \ce{WO_x} (i.e. \ce{WO_{2.92}}, \ce{WO_{2.87}}) are known as Magn$\acute{e}$li phases.


Theoretical computation of electronic band structures for \ce{WO_x} proves difficult due to the aforementioned phase transition. oxygen deficiency, structure change, electronic properties vary according.

the ubiquity of \ce{WO6} octahedra is essential for not only the optical properties but the ability to insert and extract ions in the EC oxides, due to the tunnels in three dimensions serving as path for transport of small ions. The intercalation of hydrogen or alkali ions into \ce{WO3} created electron donor level. By absorbing the red part of incident spectrum, electrons at donor level make transition to the conduction band, causing the blue coloration in \ce{H_xWO3}.

its one dimensional (1D) nanostructure has attained intensive research efforts in recent years due to the potential applications in advanced nano-electric and nano-optoelectronic devices.

W plasma oxidation.\cite{Romanyuk2005} 200nm W coating on Si (100) sub, temperature at RT, 390, and 490 C, oxygen pressure 0.5 Pa, oxidation time for 10 to 3600 s. The resultant thickness of \ce{WO3} at RT  and time of 10 s and 3600 s is found to be 0.2 nm and 11 nm respectively.

\[
 d = d_0 exp(kt)
\]

after fitting, $d_0 = 0.19777$ nm, $k = 0.00112 $ s$^{-1}$, so to oxidize 1nm W coating completely, oxygen plasma time is 1450 s at 0.5 Pa partially pressure; 2 nm for 2000 s.



\ce{WOx} and optical electric field enhancement. The enhancement arise from the structure composed of a conductive layer and an insulating layer that are laminated therein.\footnote{US patent 8601610B2} In \ce{WOx} nanorods, the oxygen deficient planes are conductive, each having atomic thickness and separated by several nm \ce{WO3}. Localized surface plasmons could possibly exist on these conductive planes. Therefore SERS applies and single molecule Raman scattering using a tungsten oxide nanorod has been demonstrated. The \ce{W_nO_{3n-1}} ($n \geq 2$) exhibit $\{ 001 \}$ CS structure. Chemical formulae corresponding to n=2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are \ce{W2O5=WO_{2.5}}, \ce{W3O8=W_{2.67}}, \ce{W4O_{11}=WO_{2.75}}, \ce{W5O_{14}=WO_{2.8}}, and \ce{W6O_{17}=WO_{2.83}}, which indicates the existence of a oxygen deficient plane at every n row. Actually the value x in \ce{WOx} could almost continuously vary within a range of 2.5 to 3. \ce{W_{18}O_{49}=\ce{WO_{2.72}}} is an exception without $\{ 001 \}$ CS structure. Moreover, the oxygen deficient planes could extend along directions other than $\{ 001 \}$. For instance, the $\{ 102 \}$ CS planes appears in \ce{WOx} where x is within 2.93 to 2.98, and  the $\{ 103 \}$ CS planes for x within 2.87 to 2.93.\cite{Sloan1999}  \citeauthor{Shingaya2013} also synthesized \ce{WS2}-\ce{WO_x} structures and found similar Raman scattering enhancement. The x value is estimated by the Raman spectra peaks.\cite{Shingaya2013}(Data not shown in patent)

For photochemical water reduction to occur, the flat-band potential of the semiconductor (for highly doped semiconductors, this equals the bottom of the conductance band) must exceed the proton reduction potential of 0.0 V vs NHE at pH =0. \cite{Osterloh2008} flat-band potentials strongly depend on ion absorption (protonation of surface hydroxyl groups), crystallographic orientation of the exposed surface, surface defects, and surface oxidation processes.

\ce{MoO3}, an alternative interpretation in terms of tetrahedral coordination of Mo atoms is also proposed. This is caused by the fact that four of the six surrounding O atom are at distances from 1.67\AA to 1.95\AA, while the remaining two are as far as 2.25 and 2.33\AA. This also stress that the \ce{MOO6} octahedra are rather distorted.

The A, B excitons difference was a result of strong spin-orbital coupling. Relative PL quantum yield of WS2 between 1L and 2L is on the order of 2.

\section{ECD}


Characterization of ECD (work like a thin-film batteries) includes transmission measurement and associated EC calculation, charge-discharge time, current-time curve and the fitting of obtained data.

The coloration efficiency (CE) represents the change in the optical density (OD) per unit charge density ($Q/A$, in units of \si{\cm^2\per\coulomb}) during switching and can be calculated according to the formula:
\begin{equation}
CE = \frac{\Delta~OD}{(Q/A)} [cm^2/C],
\end{equation}
where OD = $log(T_{bleach}/T_{color})$. The EC and optical density depend on the wavelength and are usually higher in the near IR than in the visible region.
Using Ohm's law($U_s = IR = RQ/t_s$) with switch voltage $U_s$, resistance R and surface area A, switching time $t_s$ could be estimated as
\begin{equation}
t_s = \Delta~OD\cdot A \cdot R /(CE\cdot U_s).
