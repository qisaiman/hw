\section{Data Processing}

The SEM images are cropped using Adobe Photoshop for highlighting the features and fitting into text width. To obtain the dimension of specimen, scale bar was measured and compared to the size of interest using ImageJ\cite{Schneider2012} for SEM, TEM images and SAED pattern. It is worth noting that ImageJ could directly read the dm3 format generated in Gatan imaging software, which is more productive than the scale bar method.

Various spectra, be it from XRD, EDX, Raman, or UV-Vis, were redraw using Origin Pro 8.0. The peak fitting was performed using \emph{Fityk}, a nonlinear curve fitting program specialized in data processing from powder diffraction, chromatography, photoluminescence and photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, \emph{etc}.\cite{Wojdyr2010}

applications: electrically controlled optical shutters for heat and light modulation, smart windows associated with solar cell to provide dynamical control of incoming illumination.

nanoscale Kirkendall effect: the outward diffusion of metal cations are balanced by an influx of vacancies. For example, diffusion coefficient of Ni in NiO is higher than that of oxygen.

\gls{tmo} are a group of functional materials whose bleaching-coloration status can be reversibly switched using a finite durance of low DC voltage (\textless 5 V). Another important advantage of smart windows based on EC materials is the failure mode being clear instead of opaque compared to other techniques.

\citeauthor{Chatten2005} also studied the oxygen vacancy in different phases of \ce{WO3}.\cite{Chatten2005}

SG and FG experiments remain essentially the same as that of OT growth, except that in SG additional tungsten powders were distributed onto the receiving substrate, and in FG more than one piece of substrate was employed. The modification is schematically illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:wogrowsf}. More details will be provided when it comes to the discussion.

With four kinds of W powders and three layouts, we designed the experimental matrix as illustrated in Table.~\ref{tab:matrix}. The symbol $\times$ means this combination is covered in this work, and NA means otherwise.

We will first present the OT growth results in section~\ref{sec:nawox}, and discuss the other two in section~\ref{sec:sgfg}.

We found the growth using 3N source show distinctive features in comparison to the rest. This mainly arise from the higher sodium concentration in 3N source than that in others. Therefore we focus on 3N source first, and move on to other latter.

An empirical formula to relate the Raman peaks and \ce{W-O} bonding lengths \cite{Hardcastle1995} is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:wobond}
\nu = 25823 \exp{-1.902\cdot R}.
\end{equation}
And the standard deviation of estimating \ce{W-O} bond distance from Raman stretching wavenumber is $\pm0.034$\AA.
The observed Raman peaks of \ce{Na5W_{14}O_{44}} phase lies at 965, 943, 913, 808, 786, 778, 765, 695 and 107 cm. Multi-peaks Lorentzian fitting is preformed to precisely determine the central maximum. Good fitting is obtained, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:naworamfit}. We then calculated \ce{W-O} bond distance using Eq.~\ref{eq:wobond}, as illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:nawobond}. The predicted \ce{W-O} bond length comply very well with the crystallographic value of \ce{Na5W_{14}O_{44}} phase.\cite{Triantafyllou1999a} The 107 peak probably is caused by \ce{Na-O} bond.

This approach is essentially the same as previous studies where tungsten foils was used as substrate.The advantage of this method is W powder cost much less than a whole piece of foil, and provide more surface area than W foil in the same volume.

The FG method utilizes the flow dynamics of our CVD apparatus. We will discuss both of them in details.
We would like to discuss a little more on the dispersion of \ce{WO3} NWs, since the stability of \ce{WO3} dispersion is important for its applications. \citeauthor{Kozan2008} studied the stability of \ce{WO3} in various polar solvents such as acetone, isopropanol(IPA), ethanol, 1-methoxy-2-propanol (1M-2P) and N-dimethylformamide(DMF).\cite{Kozan2008} High power ultra-sonication was applied for about 2 minutes followed by a low power ultrasonic bath for 15 minutes. The the solvent was left to sedimentation. Samples was drawn out with pipette and transferred to clean substrate for observation. It is suggested that bundled NWs aggregates in 1M-2P seem to breakup at the outer branches to a small extent and turn into slightly more compact aggregate, providing well-dispersed stable suspension. Subsequently, this suggests we could harvest the as-grown nanowires by a solution ultra-sonication method. Generally there will be metallic tungsten in the core region of powder particles. The separation of NWs could be done via the route reported by \citeauthor{Kumar2008}, where separation by sonication in 1-methoxy 2-propanol followed by gravity sedimentation.\cite{Kozan2008}


The energetic sources are ion bombardment, electron beam, laser ablation, and combustion flame\cite{Rao2011}.

The solâ€“gel process is a well-known, intensively studied wet-chemical technique that is widely used in materials synthesis. This method generally starts with a precursor solution (the ``sol") to form discrete particles or a networked gel structure. During the course of gelation (aging process), various forms of hydrolysis and polycondensation take place.

In addition, doped \ce{WO3} was also demonstrated

We do not discuss tungsten oxide hydrates (\ce{WO3.nH2O}) in this work since the product of thermal CVD approach is not plagued with this complexity. It's necessary, however, to deal with hydrated \ce{WO3} in the liquid synthesis routes, as indicated in Section.~\ref{sec:woxgrowth}.


Nonstoichiometric tungsten oxides \ce{WO_x} (i.e., \ce{WO_{2.92}}, \ce{WO_{2.87}}) are known as Magn$\acute{e}$li phases.


Theoretical computation of electronic band structures for \ce{WO_x} proves difficult due to the aforementioned phase transition. oxygen deficiency, structure change, electronic properties vary according.

the ubiquity of \ce{WO6} octahedra is essential for not only the optical properties but the ability to insert and extract ions in the EC oxides, due to the tunnels in three dimensions serving as path for transport of small ions. The intercalation of hydrogen or alkali ions into \ce{WO3} created electron donor level. By absorbing the red part of incident spectrum, electrons at donor level make transition to the conduction band, causing the blue coloration in \ce{H_xWO3}.

its one dimensional (1D) nanostructure has attained intensive research efforts in recent years due to the potential applications in advanced nano-electric and nano-optoelectronic devices.

\section{moo3}

The oxidization of Mo starts at 500 \si{\degreeCelsius}, and \ce{MoO3} vapor pressure begins to increase rapidly above 700 \si{\degreeCelsius}.\cite{Margrave1967} The melting point of \ce{MoO3} is reported as 795 \si{\degreeCelsius}.\cite{Levin1959} Based on these data, the growth was designed with parameters listed in Table~\ref{tab:mooxsi}. It is worth mentioning that these parameters are selected and optimized from a wide range of combinations. When the influence of one parameter is studied, the others are fixed, following the standard practice in controlled experiments.

The growth layout is schematically shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mooxgrowth}. Notice that on the horizontal axis of temperature, zero inch is defined at the upstream edge of furnace. To facilitate discussion and provide a tight context, the author define the position of substrate as the coordinate of its upper-stream edge along this temperature axis, i.e., the substrate location is 7 inch in Fig.~\ref{fig:mooxgrowth}. The usual length of Si substrate is 1 inch. When positioned at 7 inch, it is then located in a temperature zone of $650 \sim 350$ \si{\degreeCelsius}.


From previous works in our group,\cite{predeep2011} it was found that with $T_h = 600$ \si{\degreeCelsius} and substrate placed at 6.5 in, microflakes grew at the high temperature edge of Si, suggesting the nucleation already started.\footnote{in 020510 batch} When flow of oxygen was gradually reduced, diminished size of micro-flake was observed at the same location of substrates. This results indicated the rate-determining step is diffusion when oxygen flow was in the range of 2 sccm to 0.5 sccm. It was also found the deposition amount on a particular location of the substrate is not linearly proportional to the growth time, \emph{i.e.}, the growth at upper stream edge first increase then decrease. This is not surprising when considering the 3D temperature field in chamber requires some time to become synchronized as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:mooxgrowth}. Using conditions in Table~\ref{tab:mooxsi} and 2 h growth,

We first repeated the previous growth on ITO/glass, and then found similar deposition phenomena on glass and mica substrates. We suspected that the morphology difference on the substrates employed in this study arises from the compositions difference. Both mica and glass contains alkaline elements which are absent in Si and \ce{SiO2}/Si substrates. We primarily verify this hypothesis by utilizing \ce{NaOH} treated Si substrates and found that the overall morphology almost reproduces that on ITO and mica substrates. We then propose a new growth mechanism based on the VLS process to explain the deposition of \ce{MoO3} on alkaline-ions-containing substrates.

Nanotower is a less common morphology in the structures of nanomaterials.\cite{Kharissova2010} We have not found report on  \ce{MoO3} nanotower structures, although there are several studies on \ce{In2O3},\cite{Jean2010,Yan2007}, GaN\cite{Xiao2012} and ZnO\cite{Zhang2013c}. \citeauthor{Jean2010} investigated the growth mechanism of \ce{In2O3} nanotowers and attributed it to the periodical axial and continuous lateral growth interaction, where the former was first guided by Au-In alloy liquid, and subsequent by self-catalytic In droplets (MP 156C) while the latter due to VS process. In contrast, \citeauthor{Yan2007} observed similar \ce{In2O3} nanotower growth and proposed that the axial growth is controlled by Au-catalytic VLS process. \citeauthor{Xiao2012} reported the GaN nanotower grown on Ni-coated Si(111) substrates and explained the growth as asymmetric self-copy process based on VLS mechanism. \citeauthor{Zhang2013c} studied the growth of ZnO nanotower and provided a competitive model between axial and lateral growth controlled by Zn vapor to explain the as-synthesized structures. (When ZnO and carbon mixture was used as source instead of ZnO alone, nanorods array results, presumably due to the stable supply of Zn vapor owing to the gentle carbothermal reduction.) Therefore the fluctuation of reagents is probably responsible for tapering and periodical modification, which is absent in the coin roll style growth of \ce{MoO3} tower on Si. The occasionally observed tapering or enlarging on \ce{MoO3} tower can be attributed to the cooling down growth.

We divide the growth into two stages according to the emerging time of long belts and towers. In first stage the growth is dominated by lateral growth, as illustrated in . In the second stage, \ce{NaxMoO3} is evaporated and recondensed in the low temperature region, and some droplet will form, and when at proper locations, introduce secondary VLS growth.

In first stage, the Na-Mo-O liquid is formed and have much more higher absorption rate than that of bare substrate. The absorbed species will diffuse along the surface and inside the liquid. It was difficult to estimate which diffusion path one is faster. 


\textbf{open questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Is the liquid consumed? if so, how? : evaporation
\item How the size of liquid is related to the morphology evolution?
\item Possible doping level of alkaline ions
\item other lateral growth mode such as Ni-W-S system
\item VLS-VS interaction, or possible solution-liquid-solid, VSS,
\item the interpretation of phase diagram
\item the overall molar amount of NaOH and MoO3 deposition
\item Young's parameters, contact angle informations, Gibbs free energy calculation
\item catalyst composition variation during growth
\item \ce{Na2Mo4O_{13}} phases, solid solubility of \ce{Na2MoO4} in solid \ce{MoO3} is high.
\item vapor pressure of \ce{Na2Mo4O_{13}} and \ce{MoO3}.
\end{itemize}


As shown in Fig, we found several solid clusters with diameter about 1 $\mu m$ on the top part of long belts. According to the \ce{Na2MoO4}-\ce{MoO3} binary compounds phase diagram, we expect the terminating solid clusters have a Na:Mo ratio close to 0.6. The experimental results match well with this predictions. EDX analysis reveal the presence of Na on the solid cluster but not at about 1$\mu m$ away from previous location.\footnote{the sensitivity of our instrument is estimated to be 1\% atomic level} Quantitative atomic ratio derived from the solid cluster is not close to the one predicted by phase diagram probably due to the high Mo content in adjacent area. However, XRD examinations on a short time growth sample revealed a possible \ce{Na2Mo4O13} phase(PDF 028-1112), providing an indirection evidence of the droplet composition. We also suspect that the growth will become different below 500 \si{\degreeCelsius} since no liquid would remain. Substrate placed at low temp end show.
We can also deduce that other sodium compounds can be employed as substrate treatment agent. This argument is confirmed by \ce{Na2CO3} and \ce{KI} assisted growth.


\section{ws2}
\subsection{Seeded Growth of Tungsten Oxide NWs}
With the oxidation experiments study in Sec.~\ref{sec:woxd}, favorable conditions for local growth of NWs were extracted to perform seeded growth.

\end{figure}

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sgb}, dense NWs array was obtained on tungsten powder seeds with individual wires of length up to 5 $\mu$m and diameter about 50 to 200 nm, according to the estimation made in the close-up view. Each tungsten powder stood as independent growth site (Fig.~\ref{fig:sga}) with island-layer growth on the substrates, a common feature without using tungsten powder as seed under current experimental conditions. It was occasionally observed that NWs growth was initiated adjacent some tungsten powders. This phenomenon was correlated to the local trap of vapor flow since it was more often found among the enclosed area by tungsten powders. It is also found that the diameter of NWs decrease as the distance between powders and upstream edge increases. This is a combination effect of lower temperature and reduced \ce{WOx} growth species supply. Similar phenomena were observed in other studies. \citeauthor{Thangala2007} reported that a decrease in NW density with increasing substrate temperature, and an increase of NW density with increasing partial pressure of oxygen.\cite{Thangala2007}

\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:sgxrd} is the XRD spectrum of one typical sample. The peaks under circular symbol were identified to be the monoclinic \ce{WO3} phase (ICDD PDF 01-083-0950, \emph{a}=7.30084 \AA, \emph{b}=7.53889 \AA, \emph{c}=7.6896 \AA, $\beta$=90.89$^\circ$), while the peak under the triangular symbol was indexed to cubic tungsten phase (ICDD PDF 04-16-3405, \emph{a}=3.157 \AA), in agreement with the EDX analysis (Fig.~\ref{fig:woedx}). This means that during the \ce{WO3} seeded growth of 4 h heating at 1000 \si{\degreeCelsius}, the tungsten powder in downstream low temperature region (600-700 \si{\degreeCelsius}) is not entirely oxidized. Micro-Raman scattering spectroscopy was performed on the as-synthesized sample as well. During Raman examination, the laser spot was carefully focused onto the NWs on powders and several inspections on different positions were observed to ensure the reproductivity of spectra data. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sgram}, five distinct bands were well resolved, with peaks located at 131, 265, 327, 711 and 803 \si{cm^{-1}}, respectively. This pattern was typical features of \ce{WO3}, consistent with previous study.\cite{Salje1975a,Dixit1986} The high background level probably arises from the metallic core.

TEM specimen was prepared by using carbon grid to slightly scratch the as-grown sample. Fig.~\ref{fig:woseedtem1} shows the feature of majority NWs. The growth direction is determined to be perpendicular to (002) plane. The streaking in SEAD pattern presumably arises from stacking defaults. The author also find some NWs exhibit high crystalline quality, as revealed by the TEM analysis in Fig.~\ref{fig:woseedtem2}. The NW grew normal to (002) plane with a measured lattice spacing of 3.79 \AA, which is favorably compared to the XRD peak at $23.07^\circ$ (7.7103 \AA). The sharp SEAD pattern and clear phase contrast in HRTEM demonstrated are both strong evidence of good crystallinity. This formation indicated current growth parameters have promising potential to obtain highly crystalline \ce{WO3} NWs in large scale.

In regarding to the formation of NWs on tungsten powder itself, this study assumes the driving force is related to interfacial strain between W and \ce{WOx}. Oxidation of tungsten proceed slowly at room temperature and an oxide layer of 100 \AA was found on the surface of tungsten foils.\cite{Warren1996} The tungsten powder used in current study would be covered by a thin oxide layer as well. During oxidation, different oxidation rates exist for different crystallographic orientations on the tungsten powder. Oxidation occurring at boundaries and defects are preferred thermodynamically.\cite{You2010} Compressive strain will gradually accumulate at the tungsten oxide/tungsten interface, which might limit the diffusion rate of oxygen at temperature lower than 500 \si{\degreeCelsius}.\cite{tungsten1999} At elevated temperature, cracks will primarily occur, as observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:pdtemp}. When heated up, tungsten and the oxide shell will probably relax the strain by converting into substoichiometric NWs, a similar process as suggested by \citeauthor{Klinke2005} in the chemically induced strain growth of tungsten oxide NWs.\cite{Klinke2005} It is worth noting that tungsten oxide nanowires could also formed when \ce{WO3} is reduced.\cite{Sarin1975} The elongation of \ce{WOx} is thermodynamically favorable during the conversion from metallic tungsten to tungsten oxide as well. Local evaporation-condensation process might also contribute to the formation of NWs on tungsten powder.

The enhanced yield of NWs obtained via seeded growth could be explained by a vapor-solid (VS) mechanism. External supply of growth species will condense onto the powders and substrate simultaneously, promoting the elongation of NWs on power as well as resulting island-layer growth on substrate. The local NW density in oxidation experiment was much higher than that of seeded growth. It is reasonable to presume that during seeded growth, several NWs in a small region on powder will coalescence, as evidenced by the bundled structures. At last, the author would like to point out that when low purity tungsten powder (3N) was used as source, sodium tungsten oxide nanowires were found to be dominant in the final product. The details have been published.\cite{Sheng2014} It seems surprising that when 3N powder was used as seeds, only \ce{WO3} nanowires were obtained. This result was attributed to the lower temperature and significantly reduced amount of 3N powder used in the seeded growth, compared with the conditions used in Ref.\cite{Sheng2014}. The source material in seeded growth is not limited to high purity tungsten powder. Instead, any material that could produce appropriate growth vapor could be employed, indicating the versatility of this approach.

\subsection{Optimization of W powder Oxidization}\label{sec:woxd}

Understanding the oxidation of tungsten powder is the key to obtain high yield in seeded growth. Oxidation of tungsten have been investigated under diverse conditions, such as at elevated temperature (\textgreater 1100 \si{\degreeCelsius} ) and oxygen pressure on the order of Torr,\cite{Base1965} and at temperatures ranging from 20 to 500 \si{\degreeCelsius} under atmosphere pressure.\cite{Warren1996} \ce{WO_x} NWs were readily found when tungsten (foil, wire, or powder) is oxidized under various conditions.\cite{Zhu1999,Karuppanan2007,Hsieh2010} However the study on tungsten powder oxidation behavior between intermediate temperature range and under low pressure is still rare. This work studied the oxidation of tungsten powders with diverse size within temperature range from 500 to 1000 \si{\degreeCelsius} and under several mTorr oxygen partial pressure. Using tungsten powder as seed, the author further illustrate an economic approach to obtain large yield of \ce{WO3} nanowires at relatively lower temperature than previous efforts. It is demonstrated that there is an optimal tungsten powder size under our experimental conditions for seeded growth. This will provide some insight on the role of tungsten powder as source material in CVD growth of \ce{WO_x}.

Commercial available tungsten powders with different size are usually associated with purity variation as well, as already listed in Table.~\ref{tab:ch5pre}. The dimensions of tungsten powder were obtained by measuring the average size in SEM graphs. A systematic investigation was performed on the oxidation behavior of tungsten powder to evaluate the temperature effect, size-dependence and influence of oxygen partial pressure.

\label{fig:pdtemp}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:pdtemp} illustrated the effect of temperature on the morphological change and surface nanowires formation of 3N powder. At 500 \si{\degreeCelsius}, most tungsten powder retained its original shape and a layer of tiny dense NWs begun to grow. When temperature was increased to 600 \si{\degreeCelsius}, 3N powder started to crack with longer NWs on the isolated surface. Further increase of temperature lead to irregular shapes of tungsten power and aggregation of NWs, giving rise to the nanorods and bunched or bundled structures. It could be determined from the morphology variation that the optimal seeded growth temperature for 3N powder was in the range of 600 to 650 \si{\degreeCelsius}.

\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:pdsize} depicted the oxidation of different sizes of tungsten powder under the same experimental conditions. In contrast to the morphology of 3N powder shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pdtemp}, 3N5 powder surface is primarily covered with sub-micro particles as well as some short tiny NWs, whereas 4N5 and 5N powder were thoroughly oxidized, showing branched flowers feature. This dramatic difference could be explained in terms of surface energy and oxygen diffusion. With smaller dimension, the increased surface-to-volume ratio and short diffusion path both lower the energy barrier of oxidation.\cite{tungsten1999} It was logical to deduce that higher temperature or increased oxygen level might favor the NWs formation on 3N5 powder. When it comes to seeded growth, however, the powder size distribution was an important factor to give uniform NWs deposition. Since the size distribution of 3N powder is more uniform than that of 3N5 powder, the author employed the former as seeds.

\label{fig:pdoxy}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:pdoxy} depicted the morphology change of 3N powder with respect to varied oxygen partial pressure. When the oxygen flow is lower than 3 sccm, 3N powder almost stayed as the same, with cracks separating the dense layer of NWs. When oxygen flow is increased to 10 sccm, the 3N powder exemplified an enlarged version of that for 4N5 or 5N powder under 1 sccm oxygen flow. This observation again supported the surface energy explanation.
