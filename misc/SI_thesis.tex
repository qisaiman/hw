\section{KK, optics modeling, doping}

how to show the crystalline TMO is better than amorphous thin film counterparts.

In comparison to oxides thin films, 1D \gls{tmo} nanostructures (e.g., nanowires) have following advantages to improve the response speed and enhance the coloration efficiency: (1) With reduced diameters down to nanometer scale, the distance for ion diffusing into and out of the nanowires is significantly shortened. (2) The gap between nanowires always provides channels for fast ion diffusion outside the nanowires. (3) The large surface area to bulk volume ratio of nanowires is desired to improve the overall usage of material, which results in enhanced the contrast between colored and bleached states. Furthermore, doped with certain metals (such as Ti and Ag), the crystalline structure of the TMO nanowires can be modified with enhanced electrochromic properties.\cite{Xiong2008}

Concentration of charge carrier $n$ is related to gate voltage $V_g$ by:
\[
n = \frac{\epsilon_0 \epsilon V_g}{ed}
\]
where $\epsilon_r = \epsilon_0 \epsilon$ is dielectric constant of gate materials.

intrinsic silicon equilibrium charge carrier concentration at RT is $n_i = p_i = 1.5 \times 10^{10} cm^{-3}$, much smaller than silicon atoms density as $5\times 10 ^{22} cm^{-3}$.

The average distance between dopant atoms is cubed root of concentration, $d = (10^{18})^{-1/3}$ \si{cm^{-3}}$^{-1/3}$ = 10 nm.

The electron mobility $\mu_n = 1500 cm^2/V\cdot sec $ at RT for Si, and hole mobility $\mu_p = 450 cm^2/V\cdot sec$ at RT.

for p-type silicon, when the conductivity $\sigma = 1 (ohm cm )^{-1}$, the doping level is
$N_A = \frac{\sigma}{q \mu_p}= 1 / (1.6E-19 \times 450)$ = 1.4E16 \si{cm^{-3}}.

Built-in voltage $V_0 = \frac{kT}{q}ln(N_A N_D/n_i^2)$, depletion region width $W = \sqrt{\frac{2 \epsilon_{Si} V_0}{q}(1/N_A + 1/N_D)}$, where $\epsilon_{Si} = 11.7 \epsilon_0$. When applying external field, depletion width $W = \sqrt{\frac{2 \epsilon_{Si} (V_0 - V) }{q}(1/N_A + 1/N_D)}$

The capacitance of p-n junction is $C = A \sqrt{\frac{q \epsilon_{Si}}{2(V_0 -V)}(N_D N_A/(N_A + N_D))}$.

Materials that human can make define the age they live in. From Stone Age to Bronze Age and Iron Age, people evolve as mastering more and more sophisticated techniques of manipulating metals, such as alloying and annealing. Obtaining extreme high purity of silicon brings us into Information Age. Future is difficult to predict. But nanotechnology is one direction that we can not ignore. According to \gls{nni}, \gls{nanotechnology}. This definition alludes that dimension comes before compositions. It is often related to the quantum confinement or surface area in nanomaterials, which we will later revisit with specific scenario.

There are three states of matter under usual conditions: solid,liquid and gas. Solids materials could be further categorized into five groups: metals, ceramics, polymers, semiconductors, and composites.\cite{William2009} This classification is based on both composition and mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties as well as the associated functionality(i.e., \gls{ceramics} are typically hard yet brittle, insulating to electricity and resistant to heating).

We have synthesized \gls{tmo} and \gls{tmdc} at nanoscale, measured their crystalline structures and optical properties and demonstrated some devices assembled using as-synthesized nanomaterials. We aim to illustrate that by nanoengineering these \gls{tmo} and \gls{tmdc}, enhanced performances over their bulk states could be expected and new properties will arise. In the remaining sections of this chapter, we will discuss some general perspectives of nanomaterials, the growth apparatus and characterization methods that apply to all experiments done in this work. Then chapter 2 will focus on growth of \ce{WO3} and its derivative. We employed thermal \gls{cvd} to synthesize \ce{WO3} \gls{nw}, and we investigated the role of impurity in tungsten metallic powders, during which we observed a new state of sodium tungsten oxides: \ce{Na5W14O44} nanowires. We also found a method to potentially obtain large yield of \ce{WO3} \gls{nw}. Chapter 3 will concentrate on \ce{MoO3}. We explored two different growth mechanism of \ce{MoO3}:\gls{vs} and \gls{vls}. We discovered that alkaline oxides can be used as catalyst to grow two distinct \ce{MoO3} morphologies: nanobelts and towers. We further demonstrated the application of as-synthesized \ce{MoO3} nanomaterials in electrochromic devices.  In chapter 4 we discuss  We synthesized  and inspected the growth of \gls{fl} \ce{WS2}. Chapter 5 will conclude with an overall summary.

\section{crystal growth}

Nucleation is a process of generating a new phase from a metastable old phase, where the Gibbs energy per molecule of the bulk of the emerging new phase is less than that of the old phase.

\section{band and bond}

Solid and orderliness.

Two theories arise to describe the outer shell electrons and to correlate the structure and physical properties: \gls{cft} and band theory.\cite{Goodenough1971} \gls{cft} assumes weak interaction between neighboring atoms and localization of electron towards parent atom, whereas band theory assumes that electron is shared equally by all nuclei and therefore a many-electron problems follows. Description of a single electron in periodic potential fail to treat the electron correlations adequately, as the interaction between atoms becomes weaker. For transition metals, $s$ and $p$ electrons are well described by a collective-electron model, while the 4f or 5f electrons are tightly bound to nuclei and screened from the neighboring atoms by 5s, 5p or 6s, 6p core electrons, hence it matches well with a localized-electron model. d electrons show intermediate character.

\section{diffuse reflection}

The KM two-flux model has been extensively used to describe the optical properties of inhomogeneous materials that consist of scattering and absorbing particles in a matrix.\cite{Vargas1997} There are some limitation in the assumptions made in original KM model, e.g., the distribution of scattering on the optical path. And revised KM models have been proposed to eliminate these limitations.\cite{Yang2004}  

\citeauthor{Morandi2005} studied the absorbance and diffuse reflection of \ce{MoO3} and \ce{WO3} thin films using FT-IR and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The observed absorption in visible and middle IR region were attributed to oxygen defects induced donor levels.\cite{Morandi2005}

The ratio between absorption and scattering, not the absolute value of each quality, determines the reflection features.

hemispherical reflectance,

the reflecting power associated with a specular-type process is often termed reflectivity, while reflectance is the analogous term for diffusely reflected radiation. This two types of reflection are present simultaneously. 

Cauchy formula, empirical equation which has subsequently been placed on a firm theoretical basis. 

intensity for a complex quantities is obtained by multiplying the complex conjugate. 

For strongly absorbing materials, the reflected light is complementary to the color of light transmitted by it, such as gold transmission is green; 

For the weakly absorbing substances of rough surface, it will appear the same color by transmission or reflection.

multiple scattering of diffuse radiation in a medium composed of closely packed particles. 

\[
\log{f(r_\infty) = \log{k} - \log{s}}
\]

It is concluded that the KM function can be used to obtain the characteristic color curve of a given sample only in the limit of small total absorption. 

by mixing the sample with an abundance of the reflectance standard, the regular reflection is extensively eliminated. 

The color of an object depends on the spectral composition of the source. The color of many light sources can be specified in terms of the temperature to which a blackbody radiator must be heated in order to achieve a color match for the source, which is known as color temperature. 

integrating sphere: the intensity at any part of the sphere, due to the reflected light is a measure of the total flux from a particular source, independent of the spatial distribution or location of the source on the sphere.

An eucentric specimen stage is used, thus observation area remain fixed when tilting the specimen. The pressure in SEM chamber is on the order of $10^{-3} \sim 10^{-4}$ Pa, which is usually maintained by a diffusion pump, or turbo molecular pump when oil-free operation is needed. For a field emission electron source, a sputter ion pump becomes necessary due to the high vacuum requirement. 

The SEM instrument used in this study is JEOL JSM-6480 and EDX attachment from Oxford Instrument INCA. Typical observation conditions are listed as following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item SEM

\item Acceleration voltage: 10 kV
\item Working distance: 10 mm
\item Scanning time: 80 s

\item Acceleration voltage: 20 kV
\item Working distance: 10 mm
\item Dead time: $20\sim30$\%

Since the intensity of characteristic X-rays is proportional to the concentration of the corresponding element, quantitative analysis
can be performed. In actual experiment, a standard specimen containing elements with known concentrations is used. The
concentration of a certain element in an unknown specimen can be obtained by comparing the X-ray intensities of the certain element
between the standard specimen and unknown specimen. However, X-rays generated in the specimen may be absorbed in
this specimen or excite the X-rays from other elements before they are emitted in vacuum. Thus, quantitative correction is needed.
In the present EDS and WDS, correction calculation is easily made; however, a prerequisite is required for this correction. That is,
elemental distribution in an X-ray generation area is uniform, the specimen surface is flat, and the electron probe enters perpendicular to the specimen. Actually, many specimens observed with the SEM do not satisfy this prerequisite; therefore, it should be noted that a quantitative analysis result might have appreciable errors.

Similar to the photon-lattice interaction in XRD, the process of TEM could be understood as electron scattering events by the same crystal plane.

\item X-ray: characteristic X-ray for elemental analysis, Bremsstrahlung X-ray also useful for biological sample; $K_\alpha$ line from L to K transition, and $K_\beta$ from M to K transition, $L_\alpha$ line from M to L transition, Inelastic cross section, Bethe expression, X-ray energies are not identical to the ionized energy because after first emission, the atom is not in ground state until a free electron fill the last hole in the outermost shell. A cascade of transitions, Coster-Kroning transition, X-ray line shift slightly due to the chemical bonding to another atom. XEDS is not good at analyzing light elements due to the low fluorescence yield, which is strongly dependent on Z. Bremsstrahlung X-ray emission is strongly forward, 
\item SE: ejected from the conduction or valence bands, weak so only escaping if near the surface, STEM, complex cross section mechanism, 
\item Auger: Auger electron has specific energy similar to X-Ray, but is much more strongly absorbed than X-ray. Stated another way, Auger electron is hard to escape, so it is surface sensitive. 
\item CL: spatial resolution around 100 nm, 
\item collective interaction, plasmon and phonon, plasmon excitation cross section in Lorenztian form $\frac{d\sigma_\theta}{d\Omega} = \frac{1}{2\pi a_0} \frac{\theta_E}{\theta^2 + \theta_E^2}$, where $\theta_E = E_p/2E_0$,

The diameter of E-beam in TEM is less than 5 nm in general, and can be $< 0.1$ nm at best.

correction of spherical aberration ($C_s$) and chromatic aberration ($C_c$), $C_s$ is done by , $C_c$ by energy-filtering, which is more useful for thicker specimens. $C_s$ correction permits the generation of smaller electron probes with higher currents, which significantly improves both analytical spatial resolution and sensitivity. $C_c$ correction offer the possibility to form band-gap imaging and chemical-bond imaging. The limiting apertures increase the depth of field for specimen, and the depth of focus for the image.\cite{Williams2009}

TEM is initially developed to overcome the image resolution imposed by light microscopes. constitute, draw analogies, resolving power, E-beam is one type of ionizing radiation, which is capable of removing the tightly bound, inner-shell electrons from attractive field of nucleus (visible light, is non-ionizing radiation to some extent). a wide range of secondary signal can be produced, the spectra exhibits characteristic peaks, which identify the elements present in the specimen.

$r_{min} \approx 0.91(C_s \lambda^3)^{1/4}$ is about 0.3 nm typically; with $C_s$ correction, $r_{min}$ can be further reduced to 0.07 nm. And human eye can resolve a distance of 0.2 mm, therefore the maximum useful magnification is about $0.2 \times 10^{-3}/0.3 \times 10^{-9} \sim 670 K$.

\subsection{polarons}

The concept of polaron was first proposed by Landau in 1933. In ionic or highly polar crystals, such as II-VI semiconductors, alkali halides and transition metal oxides, the Coulomb interaction between a conduction electron and the lattice ions results in a strong electron-phonon coupling. A new quasi-particle, virtual phonon, can be defined corresponding to the effect of electron pulling nearby positive ions towards it and pushing nearby negative ions away. The electron and its virtual phonons, taken together, can be treated as a new composite particle, called an electron polaron; the hole polaron is defined analogously. \cite{Devreese1996}

the electrical conductivity is given by $\sigma = n e \mu$, where $n$ is the density of free carriers, $\mu$ is their mobility and $e$ is electronic charge. The mobility is given by $\mu = e\tau/m^*$ with $\tau$ is carrier resistivity relaxation time and $m^*$ is the carrier effective mass.

\section{ECD}

carrier density estimation, the stoichiometry of tungsten bronze was calculation from the inserted charge by Faraday's Law. Na diffuses slower than H+, accumulating at the surface of wo3 film and preventing further intercalation.\cite{Dini1996}

\[
m = \frac{Q}{F} \frac{M}{z},
\]
where $m$ is the mass of substance at an electrode in gram, $Q$ is the total charge transferred; F is Faraday constant; $M$ is molar mass; $z$ is the valency number of ions. 


The degree of \ce{H^+} intercalation, $x$, is determined by integrating cathodic current, and given by
\begin{equation}
x = \frac{Q}{F}\frac{M_\ce{WO3}}{m_f}
\end{equation}
where $m_f$ is the mass of film, $M_\ce{WO3}$ is the molar mass of \ce{WO3*1/3H2O}, and F is Faraday's constant. 
The color center density, $c$, is then obtained using formula
\begin{equation}
c= \frac{x \rho N_A}{M_\ce{WO3}}
\end{equation}
where $N_A$ is Avogadro number, $\rho$ is density of film.

During the test of ECD, constant current source is often used. The total charge $Q$ is then $It$. Charge density, the diffusion of \ce{Na+}, 

Characterization of ECD (work like a thin-film batteries) includes transmission measurement and associated EC calculation, charge-discharge time, current-time curve and the fitting of obtained data.

The coloration efficiency (CE) represents the change in the optical density (OD) per unit charge density ($Q/A$ in unit of \si{\coulomb \per cm^2} during switching and can be calculated according to the formula:
\begin{equation}
CE = \frac{\Delta~OD}{(Q/A)} [cm^2/C],
\end{equation}
where OD = $log(T_{bleach}/T_{color})$. The EC and optical density depend on the wavelength and are usually higher in the near IR than in the visible region.
Using Ohm's law($U_s = IR = RQ/t_s$) with switch voltage $U_s$, resistance R and surface area A, switching time $t_s$ could be estimated as
\begin{equation}
t_s = \Delta~OD\cdot A \cdot R /(CE\cdot U_s).
\end{equation}

\citeauthor{Sella1998} studied the optical and structural properties of RF sputtered thin film of \ce{WO3} and \ce{VO2} for electrochromic devices. Ionic conductor was built using transparent polymer electrolyte, which was prepared from a solution of 1 M \ce{LiClO4} in propylene carbonate which was mixed with methylmetharcylate (MMA). The main characteristics of polymer electrolyte were: viscosity at 25 \si{\degreeCelsius} $\approx$ 12920 Pa.s, conductivity $\approx 10^{-2}-10^{-4}$ \si{\per\ohm\per cm},non-hygroscopic if PMMA concentration \textgreater 30\%. A specific counter-electrode layer was not used since the encapsulated polymer electrolyte processes a very high ion storage capacity.\cite{Sella1998}

\ce{MoO3}, an alternative interpretation in terms of tetrahedral coordination of Mo atoms is also proposed. This is caused by the fact that four of the six surrounding O atom are at distances from 1.67 \si{\angstrom} to 1.95 \si{\angstrom}, while the remaining two are as far as 2.25 and 2.33 \si{\angstrom}. This also stress that the \ce{MOO6} octahedra are rather distorted.

In second state, the one with smaller droplet probably would exhibit faster growth rate in $\langle001\rangle$ direction due to its shortest lattice constant, while the other one endures more growth along$\langle010\rangle$ direction. We suspect that the liquid size that induce the tower growth is much larger than that of belts. From the final morphology of as-synthesized sample, we find that the above proposed two growth approaches could change into each other, that is belt growth could be initiated on the top of tower growth and vice visa. We assume this phenomena arise from the interaction between vapor supply, temperature and the shape of liquid catalyst. Or it may just come from the vapor transport of \ce{NaxMoO3}.
It had been shown by actively engineering the shape of catalysis, the growth direction of  InP NW could be switched between [111] and [100].\cite{Wang2013c} The same mechanism might exist in our case as well. For instance, when a belt is sufficient long and it could extend into the low temperature part, where the supply of MoOx vapor is reduced due to the consumption, and the shape of liquid might vary as well. Both will result in different absorption and subsequent diffusion rate along and inside the liquid catalyst. We also observed that belt growth could initiate from tower growth in reduced time growth. Actually this may be one possible mechanism of belts formation.

(The presence of \ce{Na6MoO33} phase is an indirect evidence for the formation of eutectic \ce{Na2MoO4}- \ce{MoO3} binary compounds at growth temperature. The bulk phase diagram may not accurately represent the phase transition occurring in catalyst droplet and solid interface. And it will usually lead to a significant temperature decrease of eutectic point from the bulk value. Nanoparticles do not completely melt and instead act as an active site for reactant absorption and diffusion, leading to a vapor-solid-solid growth mechanism. 

In vapor synthesis process, two growth mechanism exists: VS and VLS. VS process is widely accepted for the growth of \ce{MoO3}. Yet we caution that synthesis conditions should be scrutinized to determine the exact mechanism. \citeauthor{Li2002c} suggested a VS mechanism at 700 \si{\degreeCelsius} and VLS at 750 \si{\degreeCelsius} and higher.\cite{Li2002c} \citeauthor{Fibers2007} proposed a modified VS mechanism probably because the deposition occurs on \ce{Al2SiO5} with possible \ce{Al_{0.95}SiNa_{0.06}O_x} involved. Therefore temperature and possible impurity could potentially alter the growth mechanism. We divide the growth results into two categories: on Si substrate and on non-Si substrate, and describe them respectively. We also briefly mention using liquid exfoliation to prepare few layer \ce{MoO3}.

This rectangular shape implies the boundary plane along growth direction (long axis) is (001), in consistency with previous experimental reports\cite{Zeng1998,Li2002b} and theoretical studies.\cite{Firment1983,Cora1997} We also observed different shapes, i.e., elongated hexagonal using similar growth conditions. This is not an indication of different growth mode. It is a normal thermodynamic fluctuation. The growth rates along different crystalline direction of \ce{MoO3} are determined by the free surface energy. In fact, (201), (101) and (102) planes have all been observed as terminating planes.\cite{Zeng1998} The stacking rate of \ce{MoO6} octahedra along $a$ and $c$ axis could develop some other ratio. And the coexistence of different planes in one growth suggests the similarity of free surface energies between these surfaces. In other words, the migration barrier of adatoms on (010) plane is presumably much lower than that on other low index planes due to the Van der Waals interaction nature along [010] direction.


\citeauthor{Hardcastle1990} summarized an empirical formula to relate the Raman peaks and \ce{Mo-O} bonding lengths.\cite{Hardcastle1990} This correlation assumes general form as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mobond}
\nu = A \exp{B\cdot R},
\end{equation}
where $A=32895$ and $B=-2.073$ are fitting parameters, R is bond distance in unit of \AA. Given a stretching frequency, the resolution for calculated bond distance is $\pm0.016$ \AA. Another empirical expression connect the bond valence $s$ and bond distance R: $s(M-O) \approx (R/X)^{-6} $, where X=1.882 when M is Mo, and 1.904 when M is W. The valence sum rule could be then used to check the state of Mo cation. It should be noticed that not all observed Raman lines could be correlated to a \ce{Mo-O} bond distance by extrapolation of Eq.~\ref{eq:mobond}. It is then regarded as a symmetry related vibrational mode, i.e., 820 \si{cm^{-1}} in \ce{MoO3}. From the correlation of various Mo compounds, a general conclusion is the lower the stretching frequency for the shortest metal-oxygen bond, the more regular is the structure.

\citeauthor{Ramasubramaniam2011} investigated the band gap tuning in bilayer TMDC materials by applying external $E$ field. Similar research has been done for graphene and bilayer boron nitride. Semiconductor-metal transition was suggested for \ce{MoS2} and \ce{WS2}, with difference on the CBM and VBM evolution. In \ce{MoS2}, the valence-band-splitting cause the A and B excitons in optical absorption measurement. Calculation shows that CB and VB are translated toward the Fermi level with increasing E field.  The external field localized charge along $c$ axis, but delocalized that within the plane normal towards $c$, thereby driving the semi-metal transition. It was mentioned that this transition is not anticipated in monolayer \ce{MoS2}. It was emphasized that precise band gaps might be different from the author’s results, yet the gap-tuning should be universal.\cite{Ramasubramaniam2011}

Water splitting materials should process a band gap larger than 1.4 eV, considering both the NHE potential distance and practical application. The monolayer \ce{WS2} exhibits direct gap of 1.98 eV. Quantum confinement could push the gap separation farther away. \cite{wilcoxon1997} \citeauthor{Notley2013} use liquid exfoliation to prepare \ce{WS2} NPs.\cite{Notley2013} Non-ionic surfactant concentration is about 0.1\%w/w.

A1g mode using resonance Raman excitation shows upshift, which is presumably caused by folding induced strains. And TEM SAED reveal 3R symmetry. We did not observed this upshift of A1g probably due to the large diameter and few layer involved.

Nanotube growth is relatively independent of substrates and FL layer is closely related to substrate. Film growth could provide some insight into the latter scenario.

And the wave vector conservation rule is automatically filled, therefore the phonon involved is not limited to BZ center anymore.

\]


In short summary, this thesis stresses that there are several key factors in successfully synthesizing \ce{WS2} FL:
\begin{itemize}
\item \ce{WO3} powder size distribution and absolute amount (0.69 g \ce{WO3} in 10 mL acetone or IPA, inspired by the \ce{MoO3} nanoribbons usage);
\item Sulfur amount and heating method to ensure a constant sulfur-rich environment;
\item \ce{WO3} powder source to substrate distance, which is coupled to pressure and carrier gas flow in determining the transport (atmospheric, 3-5 mm);
\item temperature ramping and growth time (750-800 \si{\degreeCelsius}, 3-10 min);
\item 300 nm \ce{SiO2}-Si substrate to make OM flakes identification easier.
\end{itemize}

Four kinds of tungsten powders were used as precursor to prepare \ce{WO3} NWs, and sulfur powder was used to fabricate \ce{WO3}-\ce{WS2} core-shell NWs, as summarized in Table.~\ref{tab:ch5pre}. All reactants were employed as received without further processing. Substrates cleaning procedures have been introduced in Sec.~\ref{ch2sub}.

\ce{WO3} NWs were obtained by a seeded growth with tungsten powders applied onto the Si substrate. To find out the optimal conditions, tungsten powder oxidation experimental were carried out. 


\subsection{strain}

$E_{2g}$ mode is strain sensitive. 

\citeauthor{Ghorbani-Asl2013} studied the strain in tubular TMDC and found a linear dependence of Raman scattering on strain (3 \si{cm^{-1}} per percentage for $E_{2g}$mode).\cite{Ghorbani-Asl2013} 

For 2D materials, strain may be induced by elongation of an appropriate substrate, e.g. by uniform mechanical strain, or by using a material with high thermal expansion coefficient and varying the temperature. For TMD MWNT, tensile tests have been reported by various groups. However, to date, it is not perfectly clear whether inner and outer walls are stretched simultaneously, or rather the outer walls slide on the inner ones. The latter hypothesis would result in a broadening of the Raman signals, while the first one would leave the signal widths rather unaffected. In any case, there would be a shift of the Raman signals that can serve as precise scale for determining the strain.\cite{Ghorbani-Asl2013}


\citeauthor{Virsek2007} performed a Raman-TEM integrated study on multiwalled \ce{WS2} NT with diameter \textgreater 200 nm. The tubes were synthesized using chemical transport method. Up-shift of Raman is explained by strain in the walls. This shift is not observed in the specimen by sulfurization process of oxides. Applied hydrostatic pressure is isotropic,\cite{Staiger2012} while the strain is expected to anisotropic. Strain can also be relaxed by chirality.\cite{Virsek2007}

\section{MB}

MB is a heterocyclic aromatic dye which is blue colored in oxidizing environment. Upon reduction, MB is turned into colorless leuco MB. This can be used as an oxygen indicator in food industry. Photo-bleaching of MB can be also due to its leuco formation rather than total decomposition. Photocatalytic decomposition can be minimized by keeping the solution at acidic condition (pH = 4), which will limit the formation of oxidative hydroxyl radicals (E = 2.8 eV vs normal hydrogen electrode). Oxygen dissolved in the solution play a key role in conversion of LMB to MB under visible light. Purging with \ce{N2} for 20 min

\citeauthor{DiPaola1999} also concluded that the actual efficiency of mixed \ce{WS2}-\ce{WO3} catalysts depends on the ratio of each composition present of the surface of the particles, and the maximum of photoactivity is obtained with 40-50\% surface molar ratio of \ce{WS2}.

common wisdom expect that a dye incapable of injecting an electron at the excited state to CdS. MB, which process N-methyl groups in its molecular structure and does not sensitize CdS is an exemplary candidate. quantum efficiency is defined as probability of MB converted to azure B per incident photon. QE of CdS to MB decomposition is reduced in nitrogen bubbling treated solutions, indicating the necessity of oxygen. Two possible mechanisms: a) adsorbed oxygen acts as a trap for the conduction electron and prevent the accumulation of negative charge within space charge region of CdS, supported by the formation of \ce{O2^-} in excitation of CdS in aqueous suspension.\cite{Takizawa1978}

which indicates the total oxidation of $10 \mu M$ MB would exhaust the ambient oxygen concentration of initially air-equilibrated solutions (about $250 \mu M$ ). ref 28 Thus the transport of both oxygen and MB to the photocatalyst surface are anticipated to be key factors.

photoelectrochromism at \ce{TiO2}/MB interface and its control. Efficient capture of photogenerated holes by a reducing agent is crucial to the reversibility of bleach-recoloration transition. This transition is kinetically dictated by electron transfer. Holes transfer is not desired.\cite{DeTacconi1997}

256 nm band is associated to the presence of LMB. LMB formation is not favored at alkaline pH values in aqueous solution. The OH radicals are generated either with the surface hydroxyl groups on \ce{TiO2} or with water, and its high oxidizing power cause photocatalytic decomposition of the dye.

An elementary step in decomposition of MB is N-dealkylation, which is preceded by radical cation formation.\cite{Takizawa1978} This radical cation can be spectroscopically monitored by the presence of 520nm band for MB. In MB absorption spectrum, 664 and 614 nm band ratio is related to monomer and dimer relaxation.
\begin{align}
\cee{TiO2 &\rightarrow e_{CB}^- + h_{VB}^+ \\
h_{VB}^+ + red &\rightarrow ox\\

Measure the ratio between 614 and 663 nm before and after adding WS2 can indicate the adsorption of monomer and dimer MB.

MB can act as sacrificial electron acceptor in the reduction to leuco form. The decomposition is favored under oxygen-rich environment. MB feature peaks at 663, 614 and 292 nm, and $\epsilon_{660}=10^5 M^{-1}cm^{-1}$. The doubly reduced form of MB, LMB has feature peak at 256 nm. The singly reduced form of MB, \ce{MB.^-} is pale yellow, with peak at 420nm.\cite{Mills1999}
