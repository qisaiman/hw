`` Nanotubes not fully converted appeared also during short
runs with higher working pressure. HRTEM observations
revealed an amorphous phase inside some of the nanotubes’
hollow cores, generally near the nanotubes tip (Fig. 5a). The
amorphous phase occupies only a small fraction of the nanotube’s
core volume. A meniscus is found to form at the contact
point between the amorphous matter and the nanotube’s walls.
Fig. 5b displays such a meniscus in the nanotube core (marked
by arrows). The presence of this meniscus indicates that this
amorphous material solidified from a molten phase during the
cool-down period of the sample. The meniscus of the amorphous
phase suggest that the amorphous matter wets the
nanotubes’ walls. Since the WS2 nanotubes are hydrophobic,
this observation indicates that a monomolecular layer of oxide
is left on the entire hollow core of the nanotubes. The nanotube
walls near the contact area with the meniscus are quite defective,
probably due to the large differences between the thermal
expansion coefficients of the WS2 and the amorphous matter,
which induces strain during the cool-down period of the
reaction product. These observations are consistent with the
notion that the amorphous material inside the core is an oxide
phase which is hydrophilic and does not wet the hydrophobic
WS2 layers''\cite{Margolin2004}

Exposure of hydrocarbon or evaporated carbon onto transition metal, the formation of graphite was surmised as a consequence of diffusion and segregation of carbon impurities from bulk to surface. carbon solubility in the metal and. 

The lack of control over layer No on Ni is partially attributed to the face that the segregation of carbon from the metal carbide upon cooling occurs rapidly within the Ni grains and heterogeneously at the grain boundaries. phase diagram of Ni and C reveals that the solubility of carbon in nickel at high T \textgreater 800 C form a solid solution. metastable phase \ce{Ni3C} promote the precipitation of C out of Ni. Carbon preferentially precipitates out at the grain boundaries of polycrystalline Ni subs so the thickness at graphite is higher than within grains. On Fe, due to the high affinity between Fe and C (\ce{Fe3C} is a stable carbide), the formation of $sp^2$ crystalline carbon film is suppressed. 

on copper (decomposition of methane gas at 1100 C), independent of heating or cooling rate. For copper, the 3d shell is filled, leading to less reactive configuration and weaker affinity towards Carbon. Cu can only form soft bonds with C via the charge transfer from the $\pi$ electron in  sp2 hybridized C to the empty 4s states of copper, as supported by the fact that copper does not form any carbide phase, and low C solubility. This low affinity and weak bond makes copper a true catalyst fro graphitic carbon formation. pre-treatment of copper foil, \ce{CuO}, \ce{Cu2O} removal by reducing annealing at 1000 C.

\]
the potential for a dipole becomes
\[
\phi - \phi_0 = \frac{I\rho}{2\pi}\log r_1/r_2,

When equal spacing probes are used, then potential difference between two inner points is 
\[
\delta\phi = V = \frac{I \rho}{\pi}\log2,

so sheet resistivity $\rho$ is obtained as

\section{The physics of semiconductor}


quantum well devices exploit spatial quantization effects to increase the efficiency as well as alter the lasing threshold, and novel semiconductor is made to emit light at wavelengths different from those possible when only bulk material is used.

The discontinuity in the CB and CB occurs at the interface. The corresponding potential discontinuity create a potential difference, forming a trap in which electron or hole can only have discrete energies.

a material of smaller bandgap is sandwiched between two layers of material of greater bandgap, or vice versa.

chemical potential (Fermi level) as a measure of particle concentration.  Fermi level at 0K is equal to Fermi energy, which is defined as the energy of the topmost filled orbital. In equilibrium, the Fermi level $E_f$ is uniform throughout the material. n electron carrier, p holes carrier.

band diagram represents the electron's potential energy.

band bending: the electron energies are greater on the p side than on the n side, or the electrostatic potential is greater on the n side than on the p side, since potential $V = E/-q$.

The built-in potential for a homojunction is equal to the full band bending in equilibrium.

heterojunction: bandgap discontinuity, to solve the Poisson's equation for band bending.

Metal-Semi: metal cannot support any potential difference across it. Fermi level in Semi is pinned at the interface. Electron transfer from n-type semi to metal, leaving ionized donors behind.

ohmic contact forms if the work function of the metal is less than that of the semi. net flow of electron from metal into semi, no depletion layer forms.

metal-oxide-semi as MIS structures is capacitive in nature since no dc current flows under bias.
