The quantitative analysis of phenol was performed via a standard colorimetric method.\footnote{\url{http://omlc.ogi.edu/spectra/PhotochemCAD/html/072.html}}
\citeauthor{DiPaola1999} prepared \ce{WS2}-\ce{WO3} mixture in two methods, sulfurization of \ce{WO3} and oxidation of \ce{WS2},with the latter are more active.
\citeauthor{DiPaola1999} also concluded that the actual efficiency of mixed \ce{WS2}-\ce{WO3} catalysts depends on the ratio of each composition present of the surface of the particles, and the maximum of photoactivity is obtained with 40-50\% surface molar ratio of \ce{WS2}.

(Ramasubramaniam, Naveh, \& Towe, 2011) investigate the band gap tuning in bilayer TMD materials by applying external E field. Similar research has been done for graphene and bilayer boron nitride. Semiconductor-metal transition was suggested for \ce{MoS2} and WS2, with difference on the CBM and VBM evolution. In \ce{MoS2}, the valence-band-splitting cause the A and B excitons in optical absorption measurement. Calculation shows that CB and VB are translated toward the Fermi level with increasing E field.  The external field localized charge along C axis, but delocalized that within the plane normal towards C, thereby driving the semi-metal transition. It was mentioned that this transition is not anticipated in monolayer \ce{MoS2}. It was emphasized that precise band gaps might be different from the author’s results, yet the gap-tuning should be universal.

(Shi, Pan, Zhang, \& Yakobson, 2013) studied the strained monolayer \ce{MoS2} and WS2. The results show that exciton binding energy is insensitive to the strain, while optical band gap becomes smaller as strain increases. Monolayer WS2 PL maximum located at about 1.95eV. Calculation shows the electron effective mass of WS2 is the smallest, rendering higher mobility in device.

(Kośmider \& Fernández-Rossier, 2013) studied the heterojunction between two monolayers of \ce{MoS2} and WS2. Top of VB in W layer and bottom of CB in Mo layer, forming type II structure. bilayer gap 1.2 eV.


Lattice vibration in hexagonal \ce{MoS2} was studied by (Wieting & Verble, 1971) using infrared and Raman spectroscopy. 15 optical modes are allowed assuming 6 atoms in primitive cell. Refractive indices was calculated as n0= 3.9, ne = 2.5. \cite{Wieting1971}

Band structure  of \ce{MoS2} in bulk form was calculated by (Mattheiss, 1973). There is some controversy about the exact value of bandgap. The calculation result is 1.2eV ( indirect gap).\cite{Mattheiss1973}

Alkali metal intercalated \ce{WS2} film was prepared.(Homyonfer et al., 1997) Stage 6 superlattice formation was suggested according to X-ray diffraction, and photoresponse spectra and electron tunneling measurement were done.

Sulfurizaiton of W film, (Jäger-Waldau, Lux-Steiner, Jäger-Waldau, & Bucher, 1993)

(Splendiani et al., 2010) reported the PL in monolayer \ce{MoS2}.  Calculation indicated the indirect gap become larger when thinning, while the previous direct one almost stays as the same, the value is about 1.85eV (direct gap).\cite{Splendiani2010}

(Zhou et al., 2010) heterojunction is employed to transferred photo-generated carriers. schottky barrier conduction band electron trapping and consequent longer electron-hole pair lifetimes. Numerous studies have suggested that fine particles of transition metals or their oxides, when dispersed on the surface of a photocatalyst matrix, can act as electron traps on n-type semiconductors.

\subsection{chromic}

the electrical conductivity is given by $\sigma = n e \mu$, where $n$ is the density of free carriers, $\mu$ is their mobility and $e$ is electronic charge. The mobility is given by $\mu = e\tau/m^*$ with $\tau$ is carrier resistivity relaxation time and $m^*$ is the carrier effective mass.


The degree of \ce{H^+} intercalation, $x$, is determined by integrating cathodic current, and given by
\begin{equation}
x = \frac{Q}{F}\frac{M_\ce{WO3}}{m_f}
\end{equation}
where $m_f$ is the mass of film, $M_\ce{WO3}$ is the molar mass of \ce{WO3*1/3H2O}, and F is Faraday's constant.
The color center density, $c$, is then obtained using formula
\begin{equation}
c= \frac{x M_\ce{WO3}N_A}{\rho}
\end{equation}
where $N_A$ is Avogadro number, $\rho$ is density of film.


In second state, the one with smaller droplet probably would exhibit faster growth rate in $\langle001\rangle$ direction due to its shortest lattice constant, while the other one endures more growth along$\langle010\rangle$ direction. We suspect that the liquid size that induce the tower growth is much larger than that of belts. From the final morphology of as-synthesized sample, we find that the above proposed two growth approaches could change into each other, that is belt growth could be initiated on the top of tower growth and vice visa. We assume this phenomena arise from the interaction between vapor supply, temperature and the shape of liquid catalyst. Or it may just come from the vapor transport of \ce{NaxMoO3}.
It had been shown by actively engineering the shape of catalysis, the growth direction of  InP NW could be switched between [111] and [100].\cite{Wang2013c} The same mechanism might exist in our case as well. For instance, when a belt is sufficient long and it could extend into the low temperature part, where the supply of MoOx vapor is reduced due to the consumption, and the shape of liquid might vary as well. Both will result in different absorption and subsequent diffusion rate along and inside the liquid catalyst. We also observed that belt growth could initiate from tower growth in reduced time growth. Actually this may be one possible mechanism of belts formation.

(The presence of \ce{Na6MoO33} phase is an indirect evidence for the formation of eutectic \ce{Na2MoO4}- \ce{MoO3} binary compounds at growth temperature. The bulk phase diagram may not accurately represent the phase transition occurring in catalyst droplet and solid interface. And it will usually lead to a significant temperature decrease of eutectic point from the bulk value. Nanoparticles do not completely melt and instead act as an active site for reactant absorption and diffusion, leading to a vapor-solid-solid growth mechanism. )
