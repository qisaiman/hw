\section{literature review}


Shortly after the the discovery of carbon nanotube (CNT) in 1991,\cite{Iijima1991} its transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) counterparts (\ce{WS2}) was synthesized in 1992.\cite{Tenne1992} In the following decade, other TMDC and several metal oxides nanotubes were demonstrated as well. \citeauthor{Rao2003} did an excellent job to review these inorganic nanotubes.\cite{Rao2003} Here we just recapitulate the main categories of synthesis methods.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Reducing \ce{MO3} in \ce{H2} and \ce{H2S} atmosphere\footnote{M = Mo, W in this work}
\item Direct decomposition of \ce{MS3}
\item Decomposition of the ammonium salt \ce{(NH4)2MS4}
\item Using CNT as templates, arc discharge, or laser ablation
\end{enumerate}

Except the aforementioned methods, another important reaction in CVD domain is
\[
\cee{MoCl5(WCl6) + S \rightarrow MoS2(WS2) + S2Cl2}.
\]
This reaction has been explored by several authors,\cite{Stoffels1999} and could be used under atmospheric pressure.\cite{Li2004a}

All these methods can be applied to the growth of TMDC few layer structures, either directly or with some modification or combination, as we shall discuss later. Among all the members of TMDC nanotubes, \ce{WS2} and \ce{MoS2} NTs are probably the most well investigated.\cite{Homyonfer1997,Tenne1998,Frey1998,Frey1999,Rothschild2000,Zak2000} The reaction mechanism of \ce{WO3} with \ce{H2}/\ce{H2S} has been thoroughly studied \cite{Feldman1998} and high yield synthesis approach has been established.\cite{Margolin2004} For precursor of \ce{WO3} NPs, it was found that the simultaneous reduction and sulfurization is essential for encapsulation of fullerene like \ce{WS2} structures from the oxide nanoparticles. During the surfurization process, remaining oxide core is gradually reduced and transformed into an ordered superlattice of $\{ 001 \}$ CS planes. It is worth noting that \ce{MS2} can be prepared by direct sulfurization from its oxides phase, but reaction \cee{MO3 + Se \rightarrow MSe2} will not proceed unless introducing other reducing agents, such as \ce{H2}.\cite{Tsirlina1998} This fact highlights that sulfur is rather radical at elevated temperature.

Parallel with the scenario of CNT and graphene, TMDC few layer structures attracts intensive research efforts recently. These unfolded TMDC nanotubes exhibit many appealing features, i.e., indirect-to-direct band gap transition,\cite{Splendiani2010} valley electronics, and become a promising candidate in energy harvesting, optoelectronics.

For scientific research purpose, exfoliation by liquid \cite{Smith2011} or mechanical methods \cite{Lee2010a} can provide plenty materials. Yet considering the integration into current microelectronic process, CVD synthesis of TMDC FL is desired, which hold the greatest potential for high yield production of \ce{MS2}. So in this work we focus on the CVD-based methods, as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:tmsgrowth}.

\citeauthor{Lee1994} studied the CVD of \ce{MoS2} by \ce{MoCl5} or \ce{MoF6} and \ce{H2S} in great details. Phase diagrams for \ce{Mo-S-Cl-H} and \ce{Mo-S-F-H} system at 1 kPa were simulated. \citeauthor{Endler1999} also investigated the solid-phase diagram for \ce{Mo-S-Cl-H-Ar} system.\cite{Endler1999} It was found pure \ce{MoS2} was main product when molar ratio of \ce{H2S}-\ce{MoCl5} exceeds 2. More important, \ce{MoS2} basal plane orientation can be parallel to substrate when the thickness was smaller than 50 nm.

\citeauthor{Regula1997} studied the Ni-W-S phase diagram and the role of Ni layer in promoting \ce{WS2} film growth from amorphous \ce{WS3}.\cite{Regula1997} \emph{In-situ} TEM analysis confirmed the formation of \ce{NiS_x} droplets and lateral growth of \ce{WS2} from these droplets. \cite{Regula1998}

\citeauthor{Cong2013} prepared monolayer \ce{WS2} on 300nm \ce{SiO2}-Si by sulfurization of \ce{WO3} powders in a one-end sealed tube.\cite{Cong2013} It was suggested that pre-cleaning the inner tube by IPA and DI water could effectively increase the pressure of vapor source. This observation probably arise from the reduction of \ce{WO3} assisted by IPA and water residuals, or due to the possible presence of \ce{H2S}. Intermediate phase \ce{WO_yS_{2-y}} and \ce{WS_{2+x}} is proposed in the growth mechanism. Possible thick \ce{WS_{2+x}} flakes decompose subsequently, leading to ML \ce{WS2}. Sulfurization mechanism study of \ce{WO3} suggested \ce{W^{6+}} cannot be directly reduce to \ce{W^{4+}} in \ce{WS2}.\cite{VanderVlies2002,VanderVlies2002a} Tungsten oxysulfides was necessary as the intermediate phase. Other chalcogenide has also been synthesized using this one-end sealed layout.\cite{Mukherjee2013}

\citeauthor{Zhang2013h} synthesized \ce{WS2} on sapphire using \ce{WO3} powder and sulfur as precursor under 900 \si{\degreeCelsius}.  \cite{Zhang2013h} Ar slightly mixed with \ce{H2} is used to tailor the shape of \ce{WS2} flakes. It was found the source substrate distance play an important role in determining the morphology of as-grown flakes. \citeauthor{Peimyoo2013} prepared \ce{WS2} on \ce{SiO2}/Si using \ce{WO3} powder and sulfur at 800 \si{\degreeCelsius}, aiming at the light emission studies to clarify several contradictory reports.\cite{Peimyoo2013} Uniform PL intensity was found on the triangular \ce{WS2} flakes, in contrast to previous edge enhanced PL.\cite{Berkdemir2013} It is worth noting that the growth conditions in Ref \cite{Peimyoo2013} and \cite{Zhang2013h} are basically identical except the usage of substrate. The flake size on sapphire seem larger than that on \ce{SiO2}/Si, either due to the nucleation barrier difference or the amount of growth vapor and growth time.


\cite{Song2013} ALD \ce{WS2}


\citeauthor{Cao2014} studied the layer-dependence \ce{MoS2} electrocatalysis and propose the vertical hopping efficiency of electrons instead of the edge site numbers is a key factor for catalytic reaction.\cite{Cao2014} ref19,20

In studying the growth of TMDC, two issues dominate: one is the reaction of precursor, the other is the surface energy status of receiving substrates. For \ce{MoS2}, the reaction mechanism of \ce{MoO3} to \ce{MoS2} was studied by \citeauthor{Weber1996}.\cite{Weber1996} This study provided guideline for the recent syntheses of \ce{MoS2} by sulfurization of \ce{MoO3}. \cite{Lin2012,Lee2012b,Liu2012a}

\section{ and Layer configuration}

\citeauthor{Zhu2000} performed a detailed morphological and structural analysis on \ce{WS2} NT synthesized using \ce{WO_{3-x}} NWs and \ce{H2S}. \cite{Zhu2000} Sulfur vacancy was found on the outer wall of NT. The tips exhibits various structures. Open-ended can be observed, more frequently than that in CNT, which is often sealed. \citeauthor{Zhu2000} suggested this open-ended tubes resulted from continuous growth on other nanotubes. And the closure configuration is rather complicated. Flat caps often dominates. \citeauthor{Feldman1996} proposed that TMDC nanotubes growth began with the reduced \ce{WO3} phases, in particular \ce{W_{18}O_{49}}.\cite{Feldman1996} \citeauthor{Zhu2000} maintained that this oxide-to-sulfides mechanism might apply to closed caps only, not to those open ended tubes.\cite{Zhu2000} TEM diffraction analysis could distinguish the chirality of NTs, as demonstrated by CNT \cite{Zhang1993} and \ce{MoS2}\cite{MARGULIS1996}. \ce{WS2} NT chirality revealed by TEM SEAD show armchair NTs dominates.

\citeauthor{Sloan1999} investigated tungsten oxides structures incorporated in \ce{WS2}.\cite{Sloan1999} The encapsulated \ce{WO_x} cores often exhibit \ce{W3O8} and \ce{W5O14} phases, both of which belong to the \ce{W_nO_{3n-1}} homogenous series, arising as a result of crystallographic shearing (CS) planes.\cite{Miyano} Some \ce{WO_x} cores show oxygen vacancy instead of CS planes, leading to prominent streaking in SEAD patterns.

\section{Raman spectra}

\subsection{TMS NTs}

\citeauthor{Dobardzic2005} calculated \ce{MoS2} SWNT phonon dispersion. The dependence of wavenumbers and their displacement on chirality and diameter were discussed. The calculation method enable studying lattice dynamics with NT diameter up to 50nm. The chiral vector $(n_1, n_2)$ is defined within the Moly plane. Symmetry assignment is zigzag when $(n,0)$, armchair when $(n,n)$ and chiral when $(n_1, n_2), n_1>n_2$. \citeauthor{Dobardzic2006} theoretically presented Raman scattering of any polarization on SWNT of \ce{WS2} and their dependence on diameter (1-20nm) and chiral angle. The author assigned 351 $cm^{-1}$ as $E_u$ for \ce{WS2} NT.\cite{Dobardzic2006}

\citeauthor{Seifert2000} investigated the electronic structures of \ce{WS2} nanotube using DFT calculation.\cite{Seifert2000} It was found zigzag (n,0) NTs exhibts a direct gap at $\Gamma$ point, whose size increase monotonically with tube diameter, while armchair (n,n) NTs, unlike its metallic counterpart of (n,n) CNT, show indirect band gap increasing with tube diameter. \citeauthor{Zibouche2012} reached the same conclusion on \ce{WS2} SWNT.\cite{Zibouche2012} It was also found band gaps of armchair and zigzag NTs increase with diameter, going from values close to bulk and approaching that of  monolayer, and for a given tube diameter, $E_g$ of zigzag NTs are larger than those of armchair NTs. This difference presumably vanishes when the tube diameter exceeds 100 nm.

\citeauthor{Rafailov2005} estimated the orientation dependence of resonant raman on one MWNT \ce{WS2} attached to the cantilever tip of AFM.\cite{Rafailov2005} Antenna effect lead to optical transition occurring only for polarization parallel to nanotube axis. And therefore resonance Raman intensity of SWNT varies as nanotube orientation. This dependence may provide a routine to distinguish different chiral NTs. 632nm excitation is used. Polarized Raman spectra is obtained, showing $A_{1g}$ and $E_{2g}$ sharing the same polarization behavior. \citeauthor{Virsek2007} investigated the Raman scattering ($\lambda=632nm$) of \ce{WS2} NTs.\cite{Virsek2007} The silicon peak at 520 $cm^{-1}$ is used for calibration. Up-shift of $A_{1g}$ and $E_{2g}$ modes were observed, attributing to the strain in 3R stacking layers.

Raman signatures of \ce{WS2} nanotubes show distinct features to the spectra of their bulk counterpart. \citeauthor{JMR7990865} observed a new line at 152 cm in \ce{WS2} NT, which is absent in 2H-\ce{WS2}.\cite{JMR7990865} Another feature is a emerging shoulder on the low energy side of $A_{1g}$ mode at about 416 $cm^{-1}$. This has been attributed to a combination mode of LA + TA phonons from the $K$ point of Brillouin zone.\cite{Sourisseau1991} A more prominent feature is the resonance profile broadening the shape of $E_{2g}^1$ mode, which is often assigned to 2LA mode. Yet there is some different opinion on these assignments. \citeauthor{Molina-Sanchez2011} label the 350 $cm^{-1}$ band as \ce{E_{1u}} instead of 2LA, and the 416 $cm^{-1}$ band as inactive $B_{1u}$ mode.\cite{Molina-Sanchez2011} \citeauthor{Staiger2012} adopted these assignments in studying the resonance Raman profile of \ce{WS2} NTs.\cite{Staiger2012} It was found that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $B_{1u}$ mode arise from curvature and structural disorder
\item $B_{1u}/A_{1g}$ intensity ratio strongly depends on excitation, and exceeds unity when excitation energy less than 1.9eV.
\item  An excitonic transition energy of NT is found have a local minimum at about 50nm, (layer number probably \textgreater 10), and increase either way. Yet all below the bulk value.
\end{enumerate}

\citeauthor{Krause2009} measured the resonant Raman using 632 and 532 nm excitation and found a split within 420 $cm^{-1}$ region, which is labelled as $D-A_{1g}$ mode in analog with the similar defect mode of graphene.\cite{Krause2009} This  $D-A_{1g}$ mode was found enhanced as diameter of \ce{WS2} NTs decrease. In this work, we will use $B_{1u}$ mode to interpret this emerging line at about 416 $cm^{-1}$ of \ce{WS2} NTs. \citeauthor{Krause2009a} confirmed $B_{1u}$ mode arise from the inherent structure of \ce{WS2} nanomaterials instead of surface layer effect. It is also worth noting that $A_{1g}$ is stronger than 2LA under 632nm yet weaker under 532nm, and $B_{1u}$ mode under 532 nm become less prominent than that of 632 nm.\cite{Krause2009a} This is in consistent with our observation of Raman spectra on the \ce{WS2}-\ce{WO_x} structures.


\subsection{TMS bulk and FL}


Lattice vibration of natural \ce{MoS2} crystal was studied by \citeauthor{Wieting1971} using infrared and Raman spectroscopy.\cite{Wieting1971} Hexagonal \ce{MoS2} belongs to space group $D_{6h}^4$, and the repeat unit in $c$ axis contains two layers, where sulfur atoms in one layer are directly above the molybdenum atoms in adjacent layers, which is often referred as 2H-\ce{MoS2}. The lattices dimensions are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:ms2lattice}, and vibration modes in Table~\ref{tab:tmslattice}.\footnote{The symmetry is reduced from $D_{6h}$ to $D_{3h}$ when thinning to monolayer, with the absence of inversion center.} Group theory predicts two infrared- and four Raman-active modes for 2H-\ce{MoS2}, which are mutually exclusive when the center of inversion is present. It was found the $E_{1u}$ IR mode and one $E_{2g}$ Raman mode are nearly degenerate in energy. 15 optical modes are allowed assuming 6 atoms in primitive cell. Refractive indices from reflectivity measurement were n0= 3.9, ne = 2.5.

\citeauthor{Sourisseau1991} investigated the resonant Raman profiles in 2H-\ce{WS2} using ten different excitation wavelengths.\cite{Sourisseau1991} Dramatic intensity variation at 352 cm was observed, which is of two-phonon signal nature, and corresponds to an overtone or combination band of phonons with non-zero momenta contributing to indirect gap absorption edge. The authors assigned this phonon with non-zero momenta as $LA(K_5)$ type. \citeauthor{Stacy1985} studied \ce{MoS2} and \ce{WS2} Raman spectra using lasing energy close to the absorption edges.\cite{Stacy1985} Second order scattering from phonon with nonzero momentum is used to explain the rich Raman spectra.

\citeauthor{Chung1998} grew \ce{WS2} film using \ce{W(CO)6} and \ce{H2S} precursor.\cite{Chung1998} Raman spectra ($\lambda=632nm$) on films with non-parallel orientation revealed (non-symmetric) the presence of shoulder mode under $A_{1g}$, which is assigned to LA and TA phonon coupling. This coupling process stem from disorder-activated zone boundary phonons.

\citeauthor{Ghorbani-asl} discuss the electronic and vibrational properties for large diameter \ce{WS2} NTs\cite{Ghorbani-asl}. Single-walled NT is approximated by 1H monolayer and others by 2H bulk structure. It was found that large-diameter nanotubes can be approximated with layered systems as their properties should be nearly the same at the scale. Only hypothetical SWNTs, and possibly MWNTs with alternating layer compositions, may show direct band gaps. Slight mechanical deformation of the SWNTs would result in a change of the direct band gap back to the indirect one, located between $\Gamma$ and $K$ high-symmetry points, similarly to the monolayers. As for 2D materials, quantum confinement to single-walled tubes would result in direct band-gap semiconductors with $\Delta$ occurring at the $K$ point. Single-walled tubes exhibit slightly softer out-of-plane $A'$ and stronger in-plane $E'$ modes. Those results indicate that the weak interlayer interactions in TX$_2$ materials cannot be associated with the van der Waals interactions only, but most probably with Coulomb electrostatic interactions as well. Raman spectroscopy qualifies as an excellent tool to monitor tensile tests of TMDs, both in 2D and in tubular forms.
For 2D materials, strain may be induced by elongation of an appropriate substrate, e.g. by uniform mechanical strain, or by using a material with high thermal expansion coefficient and varying the temperature. For TMD MWNT, tensile tests have been reported by various groups. However, to date, it is not perfectly clear whether inner and outer walls are stretched simultaneously, or rather the outer walls slide on the inner ones. The latter hypothesis would result in a broadening of the Raman signals, while the first one would leave the signal widths rather unaffected. In any case, there would be a shift of the Raman signals that can serve as precise scale for determining the strain.

As the experimental setup for direct tensile tests of nanotubes is state-of-the-art,\cite{Tang2013} the application of tensile stress on 2D TMD systems is rather difficult due to the excellent lubricating properties of these materials.

The $E$ type phonon branches correspond to the in-plane normal modes, while the $A$ type phonons result from the out-of-plane vibrations. ref 29,

\citeauthor{Zhang2013i} investigated the shear (C) and layer breathing mode (LBM) in the low frequency region of \ce{MoS2}.\cite{Zhang2013i} Even layer \ce{MS2} belong to point group D$_{6h}$ with inversion symmetry, while odd  layer \ce{MS2} correspond to D$_{3h}$ without inversion symmetry. The excitation wavelength is 532nm from a diode-pumped solid-state laser. A power$\sim$0.23mW is used to avoid sample heating. Bulk MoS$_2$ and 2L-MoS$_2$ belong to the space group P6$_3$/$_{mmc}$ (point group D$_{6h}$) There are 18 normal vibration modes. The factor group of bulk and 2L-MoS$_2$ at $\vec{\Gamma}$ is D$_{6h}$, the same as the point group. The atoms site groups are a subgroup of the crystal factor group. The correlation of the Mo site group D$_{3h}$, S site group C$_{3v}$, and factor group D$_{6h}$ allows one to derive the following irreducible representations for the 18 normal vibration modes at $\vec{\Gamma}$: $\vec{\Gamma}$= $A_{1g}+2A_{2u}+2B_{2g}+B_{1u}+E_{1g}+2E_{1u}+2E_{2g}+E_{2u}$, where $A_{2u}$ and $E_{1u}$ are translational acoustic modes, $A_{1g}$, $E_{1g}$ and $E_{2g}$ are Raman active, $A_{2u}$ and $E_{1u}$ are infrared (IR) active. 1L-MoS$_2$ has $D_{3h}$ symmetry, with three atoms per unit cell. The irreducible representation of $D_{3h}$ gives: $\vec{\Gamma}$= $2A_2^{''}$+$A_1^{'}$+$2E^{'}$+$E^{''}$, with $A_2$$^{''}$ and $E^{'}$ acoustic modes, $A_2^{''}$ IR active, $A_1^{'}$ and $E^{''}$ Raman active, and the other $E^{'}$ both Raman and IR active. NL-MoS$_2$ has 9N-3 optical modes: 3N-1 are vibrations along the c axis, and 3N-1 are doubly degenerate in-plane vibrations. For rigid-layer vibrations, there are N-1 LBMs along the c axis, and N-1 doubly degenerate shear modes perpendicular to it. When N is even, there are 0 Raman active LBMs and $\frac{N}{2}$ doubly degenerate shear modes. When N is odd, there are $\frac{N-1}{2}$ LBMs and N-1 doubly degenerate shear modes.

\citeauthor{Ramasubramaniam2011} investigated the band gap tuning in bilayer TMDC materials by applying external $E$ field. Similar research has been done for graphene and bilayer boron nitride. Semiconductor-metal transition was suggested for \ce{MoS2} and \ce{WS2}, with difference on the CBM and VBM evolution. In \ce{MoS2}, the valence-band-splitting cause the A and B excitons in optical absorption measurement. Calculation shows that CB and VB are translated toward the Fermi level with increasing E field.  The external field localized charge along $c$ axis, but delocalized that within the plane normal towards $c$, thereby driving the semi-metal transition. It was mentioned that this transition is not anticipated in monolayer \ce{MoS2}. It was emphasized that precise band gaps might be different from the author’s results, yet the gap-tuning should be universal.\cite{Ramasubramaniam2011}
