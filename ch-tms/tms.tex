In this chapter, a TEM-Raman integrated study on \ce{WO3}-\ce{WS2} core-shell nanostructures is presented. This study leverages a home-built micromanipulator apparatus to transfer the nanostructures between TEM grids and other desired substrates. This technique has enabled us to correlate TEM and micro-Raman measurement on individual nanowires, thereby enhancing the understanding of structure-property relations which would otherwise be blurred in conventional ensemble averaged methods. \ce{WO3}-\ce{WS2} heterostructure is chosen due to the potential applications in photocatalysis and hydrogen evolution. 

The remaining section is arranged in following order: a review on the growth of \ce{MS2} (M = Mo, W) nanotubes (NTs) and 2D \gls{fl} structures will be introduced first, followed by Raman spectroscopy summary on \ce{WS2} NTs and FL. The thesis will then focus on synthesis of \ce{WO3}-\ce{WS2} heterostructure and various characterizations on both ensemble and individual nanowires. This chapter is concluded with a brief summary and future work.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{synthesis Method in This Work}

Four kinds of tungsten powders were used as precursor to prepare \ce{WO3} NWs, and sulfur powder was used to fabricate \ce{WO3}-\ce{WS2} core-shell NWs, as summarized in Table.~\ref{tab:ch5pre}. All reactants were employed as received without further processing. Substrates cleaning procedures have been introduced in Sec.~\ref{ch2sub}.

\ce{WO3} NWs were obtained by a seeded growth with tungsten powders applied onto the Si substrate. To find out the optimal conditions, tungsten powder oxidation experimental were carried out. Schematic layout of each growth were illustated in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5grow} including the sulfurization process.

\end{figure}

In a typical oxidation experiment shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5grow}a, tungsten powders were loaded into the uniform heating zone and the sealed chamber was pumped down to an ultimate pressure of $5\sim8$ mTorr. Then oxygen flow varying between 1 sccm to 10 sccm (standard cubic centimeter per minute) was admitted from upstream inlet. With 10 sccm UHP Ar (99.999\%) as carrier gas, the overall pressure reached to about 100 mTorr. The heating temperature (500 to 750 \si{\degreeCelsius}) was ramped up in 30 min and lasted for 30 min. Then the heating power was turned off and the chamber was allowed to naturally cool down to room temperature.

In a representative seeded growth (Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5grow}b), 4N5 or 5N tungsten source powder (Table.~\ref{tab:ch5pre}) was positioned in the upstream end of a quartz boat and downstream about 2.5 in the substrate was stationed. Additional tungsten seed powders (3N) were distributed evenly onto the substrate. After pumping down, 1 sccm oxygen and 10 sccm Ar were admitted into the chamber, respectively. The heating temperature was ramped up to 1000 \si{\degreeCelsius} in 30 min and lasted for 240 min. Subsequently the apparatus was allowed to naturally cool down to room temperature. 

\ce{WO3}-\ce{WS2} core-shell NWs were synthesized using direct sulfurization of \ce{WO3} NWs. As depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5grow}c, the as-grown \ce{WO3} NWs were loaded into the center of heating furnace, and $\sim200$ mg sulfur (Alfa Aesar 10785, 99.5\%) was positioned just outside the upstream edge of furnace, where the maximum temperature was about 240 \si{\degreeCelsius}. After pumping down, the reaction chamber was flushed two times to expel residual air. A cold trap filled with liquid nitrogen in downstream was used to collect possible sulfur precipitation. Then the furnace was heated to 750 \si{\degreeCelsius} in 30 min, held for 15 min, and allowed to naturally cool down to room temperature. During entire growth process, 30 sccm Ar was used as carrier flow.


\subsection{Characterizations}

\subsubsection{Optimization of W powder Oxidization}\label{sec:woxd}

Understanding the oxidation of tungsten powder is the key to obtain high yield in seeded growth. Oxidation of tungsten have been investigated under diverse conditions, such as at elevated temperature (\textgreater 1100 \si{\degreeCelsius} ) and oxygen pressure on the order of Torr,\cite{Base1965} and at temperatures ranging from 20 to 500 \si{\degreeCelsius} under atmosphere pressure.\cite{Warren1996} \ce{WO_x} NWs were readily found when tungsten (foil, wire, or powder) is oxidized under various conditions.\cite{Zhu1999,Karuppanan2007,Hsieh2010} However the study on tungsten powder oxidation behavior between intermediate temperature range and under low pressure is still rare. This work studied the oxidation of tungsten powders with diverse size within temperature range from 500 to 1000 \si{\degreeCelsius} and under several mTorr oxygen partial pressure. Using tungsten powder as seed, the author further illustrate an economic approach to obtain large yield of \ce{WO3} nanowires at relatively lower temperature than previous efforts. It is demonstrated that there is an optimal tungsten powder size under our experimental conditions for seeded growth. This will provide some insight on the role of tungsten powder as source material in CVD growth of \ce{WO_x}.

Commercial available tungsten powders with different size are usually associated with purity variation as well, as already listed in Table.~\ref{tab:ch5pre}. The dimensions of tungsten powder were obtained by measuring the average size in SEM graphs. A systematic investigation was performed on the oxidation behavior of tungsten powder to evaluate the temperature effect, size-dependence and influence of oxygen partial pressure.

Oxygen flow rate is 1 sccm.}
\label{fig:pdtemp}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:pdtemp} illustrated the effect of temperature on the morphological change and surface nanowires formation of 3N powder. At 500 \si{\degreeCelsius}, most tungsten powder retained its original shape and a layer of tiny dense NWs begun to grow. When temperature was increased to 600 \si{\degreeCelsius}, 3N powder started to crack with longer NWs on the isolated surface. Further increase of temperature lead to irregular shapes of tungsten power and aggregation of NWs, giving rise to the nanorods and bunched or bundled structures. It could be determined from the morphology variation that the optimal seeded growth temperature for 3N powder was in the range of 600 to 650 \si{\degreeCelsius}.

\label{fig:pdsize}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:pdsize} depicted the oxidation of different sizes of tungsten powder under the same experimental conditions. In contrast to the morphology of 3N powder shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pdtemp}, 3N5 powder surface is primarily covered with sub-micro particles as well as some short tiny NWs, whereas 4N5 and 5N powder were thoroughly oxidized, showing branched flowers feature. This dramatic difference could be explained in terms of surface energy and oxygen diffusion. With smaller dimension, the increased surface-to-volume ratio and short diffusion path both lower the energy barrier of oxidation.\cite{tungsten1999} It was logical to deduce that higher temperature or increased oxygen level might favor the NWs formation on 3N5 powder. When it comes to seeded growth, however, the powder size distribution was an important factor to give uniform NWs deposition. Since the size distribution of 3N powder is more uniform than that of 3N5 powder, the author employed the former as seeds.

The oxygen partial pressures were 13 mTorr, 23 mTorr, 32 mTorr, and 82 mTorr, respectively with background pressure subtracted.}
\label{fig:pdoxy}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:pdoxy} depicted the morphology change of 3N powder with respect to varied oxygen partial pressure. When the oxygen flow is lower than 3 sccm, 3N powder almost stayed as the same, with cracks separating the dense layer of NWs. When oxygen flow is increased to 10 sccm, the 3N powder exemplified an enlarged version of that for 4N5 or 5N powder under 1 sccm oxygen flow. This observation again supported the surface energy explanation.

\subsubsection{Seeded Growth of Tungsten Oxide NWs}
With the oxidation experiments study in Sec.~\ref{sec:woxd}, favorable conditions for local growth of NWs were extracted to perform seeded growth.

\label{fig:woseedsem}
\end{figure}

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sgb}, dense NWs array was obtained on tungsten powder seeds with individual wires of length up to 5 $\mu$m and diameter about 50 to 200 nm, according to the estimation made in the close-up view. Each tungsten powder stood as independent growth site (Fig.~\ref{fig:sga}) with island-layer growth on the substrates, a common feature without using tungsten powder as seed under current experimental conditions. It was occasionally observed that NWs growth was initiated adjacent some tungsten powders. This phenomenon was correlated to the local trap of vapor flow since it was more often found among the enclosed area by tungsten powders. It is also found that the diameter of NWs decrease as the distance between powders and upstream edge increases. This is a combination effect of lower temperature and reduced \ce{WOx} growth species supply. Similar phenomena were observed in other studies. \citeauthor{Thangala2007} reported that a decrease in NW density with increasing substrate temperature, and an increase of NW density with increasing partial pressure of oxygen.\cite{Thangala2007}

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis on the seeded growth \ce{WO3} NWs is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:woedx}. Only W and O elements were detected on the NW array. The background level from 3 to 8 keV was a manifestation of the continuous components of W X-ray spectrum.

\label{fig:woseedxrd}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:sgxrd} is the XRD spectrum of one typical sample. The peaks under circular symbol were identified to be the monoclinic \ce{WO3} phase (ICDD PDF 01-083-0950, \emph{a}=7.30084 \AA, \emph{b}=7.53889 \AA, \emph{c}=7.6896 \AA, $\beta$=90.89$^\circ$), while the peak under the triangular symbol was indexed to cubic tungsten phase (ICDD PDF 04-16-3405, \emph{a}=3.157 \AA), in agreement with the EDX analysis (Fig.~\ref{fig:woedx}). This means that during the \ce{WO3} seeded growth of 4 h heating at 1000 \si{\degreeCelsius}, the tungsten powder in downstream low temperature region (600 -- 700 \si{\degreeCelsius}) is not entirely oxidized. Micro-Raman scattering spectroscopy was performed on the as-synthesized sample as well. During Raman examination, the laser spot was carefully focused onto the NWs on powders and several inspections on different positions were observed to ensure the reproductivity of spectra data. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sgram}, five distinct bands were well resolved, with peaks located at 131, 265, 327, 711 and 803 \si{cm^{-1}}, respectively. This pattern was typical features of \ce{WO3}, consistent with previous study.\cite{Salje1975a,Dixit1986} The high background level probably arises from the metallic core.

\end{figure}

TEM specimen was prepared by using carbon grid to slightly scratch the as-grown sample. Fig.~\ref{fig:woseedtem1} shows the feature of majority NWs. The growth direction is determined to be perpendicular to (002) plane. The streaking in SEAD pattern presumably arises from stacking defaults. The author also find some NWs exhibit high crystalline quality, as revealed by the TEM analysis in Fig.~\ref{fig:woseedtem2}. The NW grew normal to (002) plane with a measured lattice spacing of 3.79 \AA, which is favorably compared to the XRD peak at $23.07^\circ$ (7.7103 \AA). The sharp SEAD pattern and clear phase contrast in HRTEM demonstrated are both strong evidence of good crystallinity. This formation indicated current growth parameters have promising potential to obtain highly crystalline \ce{WO3} NWs in large scale.

\end{figure}

In regarding to the formation of NWs on tungsten powder itself, this study assumes the driving force is related to interfacial strain between W and \ce{WOx}. Oxidation of tungsten proceed slowly at room temperature and an oxide layer of 100 \AA was found on the surface of tungsten foils.\cite{Warren1996} The tungsten powder used in current study would be covered by a thin oxide layer as well. During oxidation, different oxidation rates exist for different crystallographic orientations on the tungsten powder. Oxidation occurring at boundaries and defects are preferred thermodynamically.\cite{You2010} Compressive strain will gradually accumulate at the tungsten oxide/tungsten interface, which might limit the diffusion rate of oxygen at temperature lower than 500 \si{\degreeCelsius}.\cite{tungsten1999} At elevated temperature, cracks will primarily occur, as observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:pdtemp}. When heated up, tungsten and the oxide shell will probably relax the strain by converting into substoichiometric NWs, a similar process as suggested by \citeauthor{Klinke2005} in the chemically induced strain growth of tungsten oxide NWs.\cite{Klinke2005} It is worth noting that tungsten oxide nanowires could also formed when \ce{WO3} is reduced.\cite{Sarin1975} The elongation of \ce{WOx} is thermodynamically favorable during the conversion from metallic tungsten to tungsten oxide as well. Local evaporation-condensation process might also contribute to the formation of NWs on tungsten powder.

The enhanced yield of NWs obtained via seeded growth could be explained by a vapor-solid (VS) mechanism. External supply of growth species will condense onto the powders and substrate simultaneously, promoting the elongation of NWs on power as well as resulting island-layer growth on substrate. The local NW density in oxidation experiment was much higher than that of seeded growth. It is reasonable to presume that during seeded growth, several NWs in a small region on powder will coalescence, as evidenced by the bundled structures. At last, the author would like to point out that when low purity tungsten powder (3N) was used as source, sodium tungsten oxide nanowires were found to be dominant in the final product. The details have been published.\cite{Sheng2014} It seems surprising that when 3N powder was used as seeds, only \ce{WO3} nanowires were obtained. This result was attributed to the lower temperature and significantly reduced amount of 3N powder used in the seeded growth, compared with the conditions used in Ref.\cite{Sheng2014}. The source material in seeded growth is not limited to high purity tungsten powder. Instead, any material that could produce appropriate growth vapor could be employed, indicating the versatility of this approach.
\subsubsection{Ensemble Measurements on Core-Shell NWs}

The morphology of \ce{WO3} NWs in micron scale almost stay the same after sulfurization, as shown in the inset SEM imaging of Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5ws2sem}. The length of individual nanowire can be up to 15 $\mu$m and the diameter varies from about 40 to 300 nm. The surface of the NWs were rather smooth without other attachments. The NWs array grow slightly larger than the W seed ( $\sim 12 \mu$m), mostly due to the elongation of NW. 

\begin{figure}[htb]

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{ws2_sem_edx}
\caption[Morphology and composition analysis on \ce{WO3}-\ce{WS2} NWs]{Morphology and composition analysis on the as-synthesized core-shell structures. (a) SEM images showing the NWs almost retain their original shapes after sulfurization, and (b) EDX spectroscopy revealing the presence of sulfur element after sulfurization.}
\label{fig:ch5ws2sem}
\end{figure}

The EDX spectrum in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5ws2sem} revealed the presence of sulfur element, indicating the effectiveness of sulfurization. Compared to the XRD pattern on seeded growth \ce{WO3} sample, post-sulfurization pattern (Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5ws2xrd}) shows a much reduced \ce{WO3} intensity with W phase becoming relatively prominent. Still the peaks at 23.44$^{\circ}$ and 24.36$^{\circ}$ can be indexed to \ce{WO3} (020) and (200) reflection, respectively. This result as well as the SEM imaging indicates \ce{WO3} NWs could preserve some long range order after the sulfurization for 15 min at 750 \si{\degreeCelsius}. 

%fig xrd ws2

\label{fig:ch5ws2xrd}
\end{figure}

This observation can also be used to account for the extreme small peak at 13.87$^{\circ}$ in the post-sulfurization spectrum. Compared the reference 2H-\ce{WS2} (002) peak (14.37$^{\circ}$, ICDD PDF 04-003-4478), this redshift indicates an increase of lattice spacing along $c$ axis (from 6.16 \AA to 6.38 \AA). The FWHM of this (002) peak is about 1.1$^{\circ}$, giving an estimation on the crystalline size of 7.5 nm according to Scherrer equation. 

Due to this small spacing, TEM is primarily utilized to observe the detailed morphology of \ce{WO3}-\ce{WS2} core-shell NWs. Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5ws2tem1} shows HRTEM imaging on typical tip and body region of the core-shell NW, respectively. A comparison with the pre-sulfurization specimen (Fig.~\ref{fig:woseedtem2}) readily reveals the formation of core-shell morphology after sulfurization. The measured layer spacing is 6.4 \AA, slight larger than bulk 2H-\ce{WS2} of 6.16 \AA, but in good agreement with XRD results in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5ws2xrd}. The clear contrast in core region also prove the lattice structure of \ce{WO3} is not seriously distorted.

\caption[TEM imaging on core-shell NWs: 1]{HRTEM imaging on one core-shell nanowire showing layer number changes.}
\label{fig:ch5ws2tem1}
\end{figure}

After examining dozens of core-shell NWs, this thesis found the \ce{WS2} layer number at NW tip was usually the largest, reaching more than ten, and the layer number could decrease to one along the NW body, but there exist some layer number fluctuation and shape modification. Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5ws2tem3} shows a smooth transition of \ce{WS2} layer number on the tip region of one NW. The layer number is about 7 on the tip corner, gradually decreases from 4 to 3 along the NW body, and stops at 2. Closer observation indicates the layer spacing is not quite uniform in the tip area, probably due to the complex curvature and bending. \ce{WS2} fullerene also show similar structures. Since the closing of the tip region could be of great complexity and the induced strain could modify Raman signal considerably, the TEM-Raman integrated measurement in this study will focus on the body region only, with those having smooth transition of layer number.

\end{figure}

As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5ws2tem4}, complicated \ce{WS2} encapsulation was observed on one tapered core-shell NW. This tapering probably arose from the sulfurization process, but could be also due to the parent \ce{WO3} NW. The diameter varied from about 200 nm to 15 nm, and the \ce{WS2} layer number also changed in a nonlinear manner. On some turning region, the \ce{WS2} seems penetrating into the body of primary \ce{WO3} NW.

\end{figure}


A systematic study on the sulfurization must be performed to understand the growth dynamics. The growth mechanism of \ce{WS2} nanotubes from oxides were thoroughly studied,\cite{Feldman1998} and it is generally agreed that the sulfurization of \ce{WO3} is a diffusion limited reaction.\cite{Feldman1996} It was also suggested that the core \ce{WO3} NWs will become non-stoichiometric phases upon sulfurization.\cite{Feldman1996,ZAK2009} This study recognizes this possibility but also consider two factors different from previous studies: one is the usage of sulfur as precursor instead of \ce{H2} and/or \ce{H2S} as in previous reports, which will accelerate the reduction of \ce{WO3} significantly due to the formation of \ce{H2O}; the other is the short reaction time and light degree of sulfurization, which probably will not distort the \ce{WO3} lattice significantly, as evidenced by the XRD and HRTEM analysis in this section. The sulfurization dynamic is then proposed as following in this thesis: the tips of \ce{WO3} NWs exhibit greater crystalline disorder, and \ce{WS2} layers on tips are folded at least along two axes, resulting a higher density of defects and thus a higher sulfurization rate; while the folding along NW body is quasi-one dimensional, subsequently the sulfurization rate could be lower. Besides, sulfurization could also initiated from the NW body, presumably due to the presence of surface defects. As a result, this led to the uneven \ce{WS2} layer number distribution along the core-shell NWs.

No obviously consumed core region was observed among most of the core-shell NWs examined under TEM. An exception is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5ws2tem2}. It is worth mentioning that some interesting growth behavior around the void region, where a new \ce{WS2} layer pushing through the already formed \ce{WS2} ones, deviating from the diffusion growth model.

\subsection{TEM-Raman Integrated Study}\label{tms:raman} 

To perform TEM-Raman integrated study, the core-shell specimen was first dispersed into ethanol solution and then dipped onto polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) support. A home-built micromanipulator with proble tip (tungsten, 100nm point radius, Micromaipulator) was used to pick up the core-shell NWs and transfer them onto TEM grids (Lacey C, 300 mesh, Cu, 01895-F Ted Pella, Inc) under 100x objective. The steps are visualized in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5ws2trans}.

\label{fig:ch5ws2trans}
\end{figure}

The transferred NWs were first examined using TEM to identify the \ce{WS2} layers configuration and the associated geometrical orientation. Then the core-shell NWs on TEM grids were probed under Raman in a location-resolved manner. Only those core-shell NWs exhibiting relative smooth \ce{WS2} wall number transition was used in subsequent Raman measurement (wall number and layer number were used interchangeably in this work, but 1 wall is not equal to 1 layer due to the tubular structure). To perform TEM and Raman analysis on individual NWs, only one NW was placed in each cell on the TEM grid (65 $\times$ 65 $\mu$m). And the low magnification TEM images and optical images were compared to map the NW location and orientation. The carbon film patterns served as a unique background to resolve possible ambiguity. An example is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5ws2map}.

\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5ws2ram}a-d depict typical \ce{WO3}-\ce{WS2} NWs used in TEM-Raman integrated study. The diameter of these core-shell NWs is around 100 nm and the length around 10 $\mu$m, allowing for up to five distinctive Raman scattering sites. Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5ws2ram}e shows the associated Raman spectra acquired on core-shell NWs using 532 nm excitation. Two strong peaks were observed between 300 and 450 \si{cm^{-1}}. The resonant nature\cite{Stacy1985} of Raman shift is recognized by the broad band at about 350 \si{cm^{-1}}.  Recent theoretical\cite{Molina-Sanchez2011} and experimental\cite{Staiger2012} studies on 2D and tubular \ce{WS2} agree this band consist of first order mode $E_{2g}^1$ and second order mode $2LA(M)$, although there is still discrepancy on the exact symmetry assignment, i.e., the presence of $E_{2g}^1(M)$ mode.\cite{Berkdemir2013,Peimyoo2013}. The other peak at about 420 \si{cm^{-1}} is assigned to $A_{1g}$ mode in both bulk\cite{Sekine1980} and few layer \ce{WS2}. Tubular \ce{WS2} structure can be viewed as rolling up the planar \ce{WS2} sheet, and new Raman features arise subsequently, \emph{e.g.}, a shoulder mode emerges on the low frequency side of $A_{1g}$ mode. Theoretical investigation suggests assigning this mode as $B_{1u}$, the Davydov doublet of $A_{1g}$ mode.\cite{Ataca2012} And experimental study confirmed this $B_{1u}$ mode arise from structural disorder of \ce{WS2} layers, and the intensity ratio between $B_{1u}$ and $A_{1g}$ strongly depended on excitation wavelength.\cite{Staiger2012} This study observed $B_{1u}$ mode under 532 nm is much less prominent than that of 632 nm, in consistent with previous reports.\cite{Krause2009,Krause2009a}

Multi-peak Lorentzian fitting was also attempted on spectra shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5ws2ram}e. Similar trend was found between the apparent peak ratio and the de-convolution value, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5ws2pr}. For a qualitative purpose, the overall intensity ratio $I_{E/A}$ between in-plane E band ($E_{2g}^1+2LA$) and out-of-plane A band ($A_{1g}+B_{1u}$) is sufficient. This value is then extracted to correlate with layer number variation. Multiple Raman spectra for each layer were averaged, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch5ws2ram}f.

\end{figure}

The intensity ratio $I_{E/A}$ decreases monotonically with the increase of \ce{WS2} wall number, a similar trend as observed on 2D few layer \ce{WS2}. The exact value of $I_{E/A}$ shows modest difference with 2D sheet, which is attributed to the suspended configuration of current core-shell NWs specimen and the presence of \ce{WO3} core. It has been demonstrated that the optical interference from dielectric environment significantly modified the Raman scattering of layered MoS2, regardless lattice vibration modes.\cite{Li2012} The author calculated the reflectivity of three different stacking scenarios to estimate the influence of \ce{WO3} and insulating substrate, as shown in. It can be concluded that under 532 nm excitation, the \ce{WO3} core shows little influence on the Raman intensity when \ce{WS2} tube is suspended in air, whereas the \ce{SiO2}/Si substrates will dramatically enhance the Raman scattering of the core-shell NWs. It could be further predicted that current Raman spectra on core-shell NWs can be used to estimate the \ce{WS2} nanotube wall numbers. 

PL was examined with core-shell NWs on insulating \ce{SiO2}-Si substrates. A typical Raman spectrum from 160 to 6000 \si{cm^{-1}} is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:ws2ramall}. This pattern was acquired on the middle spot of the core-shell NW shown as inset. Using 532 nm excitation, the multi-phonon resonant feature was clearly resolved. A broad PL peak was also observed with center at 628 nm and FWHM of 23 nm, corresponding to a photon energy of 1.974 eV with width of 72 meV.

Another feature is the presence of three peaks centering at 1860, 3695, and 5500 \si{cm^{-1}}, respectively, where the latter two is probably the secondary and third overtone of the first peak. The origin of this peak family is still under research. A possible candidate points at the hydrocarbon contamination attached onto the core-shell NWs, as already been observed using TEM imaging. Interesting the intensity of this three-peak family attenuated significantly when using 441 nm excitation, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ws2ramblue}. This comparison suggested there might be some enhancement mechanism from \ce{WS2} resonant Raman vibrations.

Three Raman sites were chosen to probe possible layer variation using both 532 and 441 nm, with the naming displayed in the inset of Fig.~\ref{fig:ws2ramall}. The Raman patterns are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ws2ram3site}a-b. The off-resonance profile in Fig.~\ref{fig:ws2ram3site}b shows only two modes, with $E_{2g}^1$ mode at about 357 \si{cm^{-1}} and $A_{1g}$ mode at $418\sim419$ \si{cm^{-1}}. In contrast, the on-resonance profile in Fig.~\ref{fig:ws2ram3site}a exhibits much richer spectra. The shoulder mode at tip2 spectrum is a manifestation of $B_{1u}$ mode from curved \ce{WS2} layer. According to previous analysis, the apparent ratio between in-plane and out-of-plane vibration indicates site tip2 has multi-wall \ce{WS2}, and the other two possibly have few-wall \ce{WS2}.

\end{figure}

This predication is confirmed by the associated PL measurement as displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:ws2plgreen}. Strong luminescent peaks were found at site mid and tip1, and an extremely weak from site tip2. The PL peaks centered at 1958 and 1934 meV for mid and tip1, respectively. The second and third order peaks also show up on all three Raman sites.

The geometrical symmetry groups of WS2 NT.\cite{Milosevic2000} 
The basis/lattice vectors $a_1$ and $a_2$ are defined in transition metal plane with equal length $a_0 \approx 3$ \AA. This monolayered sheet can be rolled up to form a tubular structure when the chiral/translation vector $c = n_1a_1 + n_2a_2$ becomes the circumference of the tube. The diameter of a nanotube is given by 
\begin{equation}
d = \frac{\mid c \mid}{\pi} = \frac{a_0}{\pi}\sqrt{n_1^2 + n_1n_2 + n_2^2}
\end{equation}
Notice $a_1 \cdot a_2 = a_1a_2 \cos\pi/3$, where the cosine times 2 is unit. 
In analog with carbon nanotube, chiral angle $\theta$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\theta = \tan^{-1}\frac{\sqrt{3}n_2}{2n_1 + n_2}
\end{equation}

Chiral angles from the interval $[0,pi/6]$ is sufficient for all possible tubes. Tubes $(n,0)$ with zero chiral angle are named zigzag, tubes $(n,n)$ with $\pi/6$ chiral angle are armchair, whereas all others are referred as chiral ones with $\theta \in (0,pi/6)$.

\citeauthor{Ramasubramaniam2011} investigated the band gap tuning in bilayer TMDC materials by applying external $E$ field. Similar research has been done for graphene and bilayer boron nitride. Semiconductor-metal transition was suggested for \ce{MoS2} and \ce{WS2}, with difference on the CBM and VBM evolution. In \ce{MoS2}, the valence-band-splitting cause the A and B excitons in optical absorption measurement. Calculation shows that CB and VB are translated toward the Fermi level with increasing E field.  The external field localized charge along $c$ axis, but delocalized that within the plane normal towards $c$, thereby driving the semi-metal transition. It was mentioned that this transition is not anticipated in monolayer \ce{MoS2}. It was emphasized that precise band gaps might be different from the author’s results, yet the gap-tuning should be universal.\cite{Ramasubramaniam2011}

Water splitting materials should process a band gap larger than 1.4eV, considering both the NHE potential distance and practical application. The monolayer \ce{WS2} exhibits direct gap of 1.98 eV. Quantum confinement could push the gap separation farther away. \cite{wilcoxon1997} \citeauthor{Notley2013} use liquid exfoliation to prepare \ce{WS2} NPs.\cite{Notley2013} Non-ionic surfactant concentration is about 0.1\%w/w.

A1g mode using resonance Raman excitation shows upshift, which is presumably caused by folding induced strains. And TEM SAED reveal 3R symmetry. We did not observed this upshift of A1g probably due to the large diameter and few layer involved.

Nanotube growth is relatively independent of substrates and FL layer is closely related to substrate. Film growth could provide some insight into the latter scenario.
