\section{literature review}


Shortly after the the discovery of carbon nanotube (CNT) in 1991, its transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) counterparts (\ce{WS2}) was synthesized in 1992. In the following decade, other TMDC and several metal oxides nanotubes were demonstrated as well. \citeauthor{Rao2003} did an excellent job to review these inorganic nanotubes.\cite{Rao2003} Here we just recapitulate the main categories of synthesis methods.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Reducing \ce{MO3} in \ce{H2} and \ce{H2S} atmosphere\footnote{M = Mo, W in this work}
\item Direct decomposition of \ce{MS3}
\item Decomposition of the ammonium salt \ce{(NH4)2MS4}
\item Using CNT as templates, or arc, laser ablation
\end{enumerate}

Except the aforementioned methods, another important reaction in CVD domain is
\[
\cee{MoCl5(WCl6) + S \rightarrow MoS2(WS2) + S2Cl2}.
\]
This reaction has been explored by several authors,\cite{Stoffels1999} and could be used under atmospheric pressure.\cite{Li2004a}

All these methods can be applied to the growth of TMDC few layer structures, either directly or with some modification or combination, as we shall discuss later. Among all the members of TMDC nanotubes, \ce{WS2} NT is probably the one most well investigated.\cite{Tenne1998,Frey1998,Frey1999,Rothschild2000,Zak2000} The reaction mechanism of \ce{WO3} with \ce{H2}/\ce{H2S} has been thoroughly studied \cite{Feldman1998} and high yield synthesis approach has been established.\cite{Margolin2004}
It is worth noting that \ce{MS2} can be prepared by direct sulfurization from its oxides phase, but reaction \cee{MO3 + Se \rightarrow MSe2} will not proceed unless introducing other reducing agents, such as \ce{H2}.\cite{Tsirlina1998} This fact highlights that sulfur is rather a radical element under elevated temperature.

Parallel with the scenario of graphene and CNT, TMDC few layer structures attracts intensive research efforts recently. The unfolded TMDC nanotubes exhibit many appealing features, i.e., indirect-to-direct band gap transition,\cite{Splendiani2010} valley electronics, and become a promising candidate in energy harvesting, optoelectronics.

For scientific research purpose, exfoliation by liquid \cite{Smith2011} or mechanical methods \cite{Lee2010a} can provide plenty materials. Yet considering the integration into current microelectronic process, CVD synthesis of TMDC FL is desired, which hold the greatest potential for high yield production of \ce{MS2}. So in this work we focus on the CVD-based methods, as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:tmsgrowth}.

\citeauthor{Lee1994} studied the CVD of \ce{MoS2} by \ce{MoCl5} or \ce{MoF6} and \ce{H2S} in great details. Phase diagrams for \ce{Mo-S-Cl-H} and \ce{Mo-S-F-H} system at 1 kPa were simulated. \citeauthor{Endler1999} also investigated the solid-phase diagram for \ce{Mo-S-Cl-H-Ar} system.\cite{Endler1999} It was found pure \ce{MoS2} was main product when molar ratio of \ce{H2S}-\ce{MoCl5} exceeds 2. More important, \ce{MoS2} basal plane orientation can be parallel to substrate when the thickness was smaller than 50 nm.

\citeauthor{Regula1997} studied the Ni-W-S phase diagram and the role of Ni layer in promoting \ce{WS2} film growth from amorphous \ce{WS3}.\cite{Regula1997} \emph{In-situ} TEM analysis confirmed the formation of \ce{NiS_x} droplets and lateral growth of \ce{WS2} from these droplets. \cite{Regula1998}

\citeauthor{Cong2013} prepared monolayer \ce{WS2} on 300nm \ce{SiO2}-Si by sulfurization of \ce{WO3} powders in a one-end sealed tube.\cite{Cong2013} It was suggested that pre-cleaning the inner tube by IPA and DI water could effectively increase the pressure of vapor source. This observation probably arise from the reduction of \ce{WO3} assisted by IPA and water residuals, or due to the possible presence of \ce{H2S}. Intermediate phase \ce{WO_yS_{2-y}} and \ce{WS_{2+x}} is proposed in the growth mechanism. Possible thick \ce{WS_{2+x}} flakes decompose subsequently, leading to ML \ce{WS2}. Sulfurization mechanism study of \ce{WO3} suggested \ce{W^{6+}} cannot be directly reduce to \ce{W^{4+}} in \ce{WS2}.\cite{VanderVlies2002,VanderVlies2002a} Tungsten oxysulfides was necessary as the intermediate phase. Other chalcogenide has also been synthesized using this one-end sealed layout.\cite{Mukherjee2013} 

\citeauthor{Cao2014} studied the layer-dependence \ce{MoS2} electrocatalysis and propose the vertical hopping efficiency of electrons instead of the edge site numbers is a key factor for catalytic reaction.\cite{Cao2014} ref19,20 

In studying the growth of TMDC, two issues dominate: one is the reaction of precursor, the other is the surface energy status of receiving substrates. For \ce{MoS2}, the reaction mechanism of \ce{MoO3} to \ce{MoS2} was studied by \citeauthor{Weber1996}.\cite{Weber1996} This study provided guideline for the recent syntheses of \ce{MoS2} by sulfurization of \ce{MoO3}. \cite{Lin2012,Lee2012b,Liu2012a}
