\section{Experimental}

\textbf{Synthesis}

\ce{WS2}-\ce{WO_x} core-shell NWs were synthesized using direct sulfurization of \ce{WO3} NWs (Fig.~\ref{fig0}). Tungsten trioxides NWs were synthesized by a seeded growth approach in a home-built CVD apparatus, which has been successfully employed to prepare borides\cite{Amin2009a}, titanium oxide\cite{Amin2007}, tungsten oxides\cite{Zhang2010} and \ce{MoO3}. The seeded growth details are provided in supporting information. The as-grown \ce{WO3} NWs were loaded into the center of heating furnace, and $\sim200$mg sulfur (Alfa Aesar 10785, 99.5\%) was positioned just outside the upstream edge of furnace, where the maximum temperature was about 240 \si{\degreeCelsius}. After pumping down, the reaction chamber was flushed two times to expel residual air. A cold trap filled with liquid nitrogen in downstream was used to collect possible sulfur precipitation. Then the furnace was heated to 750 \si{\degreeCelsius} in 30 minutes, held for 15 minutes, and allowed to naturally cool down to room temperature. During entire growth process, 30 sccm Ar was used as carrier flow.

\textbf{Characterization}

The morphology and composition of the as-synthesized samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6480) and the associated energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy unit(EDS, Oxford Instrument INCA). Crystal structures were characterized using X-ray diffraction (PANXpertXâ€™pert Pro MRD with Cu K$\alpha$ line at $\lambda$=1.5418\AA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100 \ce{LaB6} operated at 200kV). A Raman microscope setup (Horiba Scientific, Labram HR800) were used to detect Raman spectra. The spectra was acquired using 532 nm laser (0.3 mW) and 200 second acquisition time.

To perform TEM-Raman integrated study, the core-shell specimen was first dispersed into acetone solution, and dipped onto polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) support. A micromanipulator was used to pick up the longer core-shell NWs and to transfer them onto TEM grids. The NWs were first examined using TEM to identify the \ce{WS2} layers configuration and the associated geometrical orientation. Then the core-shell NWs on TEM grids were examined under Raman.

To perform TEM-Raman integrated study, the core-shell nanowires need to be transferred to TEM grid first. So the core-shell specimens were dispersed into acetone, and then dipped onto polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. Some long core-shell nanowires on PDMS substrate were picked up and transferred to TEM grids by using a home-built micromanipulator under optical microscope.

Photocatalytic performance of as-synthesized core-shell NWs was evaluated by measuring the degradation of MB. Xe-Hg lamp ( ) and a liquid filter were used to provide UV and visible irradiation and a glass filter was applied to cut off UV light (below 420 nm). All vessel and beaker are of borosilicate glass type (Pyrex), which was reported to adsorb little MB.\cite{Chakrabarti2005} In a typical experiment, 10 mL aqueous solution containing about 1 mg sample was mixed with 50 mL of $10 \mu M$ MB solution. The mixture was magnetically stirred in dark for 1 hr to allow for MB adsorption, during which the solution was sampled several times for UV-Vis measurement to confirm the equilibrium and to serve as reference point. Then the solution was continuously purged with oxygen or argon (20 sccm) and magnetically stirred (80 rmp) throughout the reaction process. No thermal bath was used but the solution temperature was monitored and the variation was found to be less than 3 K. Sample of the solution was withdraw regularly with respect to irradiation time, placed into a quartz cuvette and capped with plastic septum to isolate external moisture. The UV-Vis absorbance spectra were taken in a two beam configuration, with a paired quartz cuvette containing DI water as reference. The catalyst absorbance spectrum only provide a scattering background onto which the MB spectra is superimposed. Thus no centrifugation is employed since it does not interfere with evaluating absorbance of MB. The extent to which MB is photodecomposed was calculated the absorbance variation at 663nm. It has been known that MB can also be reduced to colorless lecuo form with absorption peak at 256 nm in aqueous solution.\cite{Mills1999} This might cause overestimation of the photocatalyst efficiency. To avoid this ambiguity, the possible formation of lecuo MB was probed by oxygen purging the solution in dark and measuring the UV-Vis spectrum again.

Methylene Blue\footnote{\ce{C16H18N3SCl} molar mass 319.85g/mol.} (Alfa Aesar 42771, 1\%w/v = 31.26 mM) is diluted into DI water to prepare reaction solution with concentration about $10 \mu M$. The measured absorbance spectrum is shown in supporting information, with maximum absorbance 0.42 at 664nm. Taking the \ce{MB^+} molar extinction coefficient $\epsilon$ as 95000 $M^{-1}cm^{-1}$,\cite{Cenens1988} then the measured concentration is $c = \frac{A}{\epsilon l}$ is $4.37 \mu M$.

\end{figure}

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sgb}, dense NWs array was obtained on tungsten powder seeds with individual wires of length up to 5 $\mu$m and diameter about 50 to 200 nm, according to the estimation made in the close-up view. Each tungsten powder stood as independent growth site (Fig.~\ref{fig:sga}) with island-layer growth on the substrates, a common feature without using tungsten powder as seed under current experimental conditions. It was occasionally observed that NWs growth was initiated adjacent some tungsten powders. We suspect that this phenomenon was correlated to the local trap of vapor flow since it was more often found among the enclosed area by tungsten powders. We also found that the diameter of NWs decrease as the distance between powders and upstream edge increases. This is a combination effect of lower temperature and reduced \ce{WOx} growth species supply. Similar phenomena were observed in other studies.\cite{Thangala2007}

\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:sgxrd} is the XRD spectrum of one typical sample. The peaks under circular symbol were identified to be the monoclinic \ce{WO3} phase (ICDD PDF 01-083-0950,\emph{a}=7.30084\AA, \emph{b}=7.53889\AA, \emph{c}=7.6896\AA, $\beta$=90.8920$^\circ$), while the peak under the triangular symbol was indexed to cubic tungsten phase (ICDD PDF 04-16-3405, \emph{a}=3.157\AA). This metallic core was anticipated considering the oxygen flow levels (Supporting info for oxidation experiment). Micro-Raman scattering spectroscopy was performed on as-synthesized sample as well. During Raman examination, the laser spot was carefully focused onto the NWs on powders and several inspections on different positions were observed to ensure the reproductivity of spectra data. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sgram}, five distinct bands were well resolved, with its peaks located at 131, 265, 327, 711 and 803 \si{cm^{-1}}, respectively. This pattern closely matches previous studies on \ce{WO3} lattice dynamics.\cite{Salje1975a,Dixit1986} The high background level probably arises from the metallic core.

MB is a heterocyclic aromatic dye which is blue colored in oxidizing environment. Upon reduction, MB is turned into colorless leuco MB. This can be used as an oxygen indicator in food industry. Photo-bleaching of MB can be also due to its leuco formation rather than total decomposition. Photocatalytic decomposition can be minimized by keeping the solution at acidic condition (PH = 4), which will limit the formation of oxidative hydroxyl radicals (E = 2.8 eV vs normal hydrogen electrode). Oxygen dissolved in the solution play a key role in conversion of LMB to MB under visible light. Purging with \ce{N2} for 20mins can remove dissolved oxygen.\cite{Wang2014a}

\cite{Yoneyama1972} MB to LMB (\ce{C16H19N3S}) in aqueous solution upon illumination of \ce{TiO2}. The colorimetric analysis was performed in a glove box under nitrogen atmosphere. The absence of oxygen is important to prevent the oxidation of LMB to blue MB.
\[
\cee{MB^+ + H2O + H^+ \rightarrow MBH3^{2+} + 1/2O2}
\]
where MB represents the uncharged center of MB molecule.

\cite{Takizawa1978} common wisdom expect that a dye incapable of injecting an electron at the excited state to CdS. MB, which process N-methyl groups in its molecular structure and does not sensitize CdS is an exemplary candidate. quantum efficiency is defined as probability of MB converted to azure B per incident photon. QE of CdS to MB decomposition is reduced in nitrogen bubbling treated solutions, indicating the necessity of oxygen. Two possible mechanisms: a) adsorbed oxygen acts as a trap for the conduction electron and prevent the accumulation of negative charge within space charge region of CdS, supported by the formation of \ce{O2^-} in excitation of CdS in aqueous suspension.

\[

which indicates the total oxidation of $10 \mu M$ MB would exhause the ambient oxygen concentration of initially air-equilibrated solutions (about $250 \mu M$ ). ref 28 Thus the transport of both oxygen and MB to the photocatalyst surface are anticipated to be key factors.

\cite{DeTacconi1997} photoelectrochromism at \ce{TiO2}/MB interface and its control. Efficient capture of photogenerated holes by a reducing agent is crucial to the reversibility of bleach-recoloration transition. This transition is kinetically dictated by electron transfer. Holes transfer is not desired.

256 nm band is associated to the presence of LMB. LMB formation is not favored at alkaline pH values in aqueous solution. The OH radicals are generated either with the surface hydroxyl groups on \ce{TiO2} or with water, and its high oxidizing powder cause photocatalytic decomposition of the dye.

An elementary step in decomposition of MB is N-dealkylation, which is preceded by radical cation formation.\cite{Takizawa1978} This radical cation can be spectroscopically monitored by the presence of 520nm band for MB. In MB absorption spectrum, 664 and 614 nm band ratio is related to monomer and dimer relaxation.
\begin{align}
\cee{TiO2 &\rightarrow e_{CB}^- + h_{VB}^+ \\
h_{VB}^+ + red &\rightarrow ox\\
MB^+ + 2e_{CB}^ + H^+ &\rightarrow LMB}
\end{align}

Measure the ratio between 614 and 663 nm before and after adding WS2 can indicate the adsorption of monomer and dimer MB.


\cite{Mills1999} MB can act as sacrificial electron acceptor in the reduction to leuco form. The decomposition is favored under oxygen-rich environment. MB feature peaks at 663, 614 and 292 nm, and $\epsilon_{660}=10^5 M^{-1}cm^{-1}$. The doubly reduced form of MB, LMB has feature peak at 256 nm. The singly reduced form of MB, \ce{MB.^-} is pale yellow, with peak at 420nm.
\begin{align}
\cee{MB + e_{CB}^- &->[pH<7] MB^{.-} \\
2MB^{.-} &\rightarrow MB + LMB\\
O2 + e_{CB}^- &\rightarrow O2^{.-}}
\end{align}

The oxidized form of MB, \ce{MB.^+} has peak at 520nm, which is stable in acidic solution, but decomposes irreversibly in slight alkaline solution(pH = 9).

A typical value of $K_D$ is 3970 1/M. A quadratic equation can be solved to obtain the monomer concentration:
\[

\]
