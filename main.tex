%\section{Crystal Structures and Electronic Properties}

Solid and orderliness.

Two theories arise to describe the outer shell electrons and to correlate the structure and physical properties: \gls{cft} and band theory.\cite{Goodenough1971} \gls{cft} assumes weak interaction between neighboring atoms and localization of electron towards parent atom, whereas band theory assumes that electron is shared equally by all nuclei and therefore a many-electron problems follows. Description of a single electron in periodic potential fail to treat the electron correlations adequately, as the interaction between atoms becomes weaker.For transition metals, $s$ and $p$ electrons are well described by a collective-electron model, while the 4f or 5f electrons are tightly bound to nuclei and screened from the neighboring atoms by 5s, 5p or 6s, 6p core electrons, hence it matches well with a localized-electron model. d electrons show intermediate character.


In vapor synthesis process, two growth mechanism exists: VS and VLS. VS process is widely accepted for the growth of \ce{MoO3}. Yet we caution that synthesis conditions should be scrutinized to determine the exact mechanism. \citeauthor{Li2002c} suggested a VS mechanism at 700 \si{\degreeCelsius} and VLS at 750 \si{\degreeCelsius} and higher.\cite{Li2002c} \citeauthor{Fibers2007} proposed a modified VS mechanism probably because the deposition occurs on \ce{Al2SiO5} with possible \ce{Al_{0.95}SiNa_{0.06}O_x} involved. Therefore temperature and possible impurity could potentially alter the growth mechanism. We divide the growth results into two categories: on Si substrate and on non-Si substrate, and describe them respectively. We also briefly mention using liquid exfoliation to prepare few layer \ce{MoO3}.


This rectangular shape implies the boundary plane along growth direction (long axis) is (001), in consistency with previous experimental reports\cite{Zeng1998,Li2002b} and theoretical studies.\cite{Firment1983,Cora1997} We also observed different shapes, i.e., elongated hexagonal using similar growth conditions. This is not an indication of different growth mode. It is a normal thermodynamic fluctuation. The growth rates along different crystalline direction of \ce{MoO3} are determined by the free surface energy. In fact, (201), (101) and (102) planes have all been observed as terminating planes.\cite{Zeng1998} The stacking rate of \ce{MoO6} octahedra along $a$ and $c$ axis could develop some other ratio. And the coexistence of different planes in one growth suggests the similarity of free surface energies between these surfaces. In other words, the migration barrier of adatoms on (010) plane is presumably much lower than that on other low index planes due to the Van der Waals interaction nature along [010] direction.

\citeauthor{Wang2013c} changed the NW growth direction by changing the shape of droplets; \citeauthor{Biswas2013} reported enhanced aspect ratio of Ge NWs from bimetallic alloy.




We first repeated the previous growth on ITO/glass, and then found similar deposition phenomena on glass and mica substrates. We suspected that the morphology difference on the substrates employed in this study arises from the compositions difference. Both mica and glass contains alkaline elements which are absent in Si and \ce{SiO2}/Si substrates. We primarily verify this hypothesis by utilizing \ce{NaOH} treated Si substrates and found that the overall morphology almost reproduces that on ITO and mica substrates. We then propose a new growth mechanism based on the VLS process to explain the deposition of \ce{MoO3} on alkaline-ions-containing substrates.

According to the phase diagram shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pd}, \ce{Na2MoO4} - \ce{MoO3} phase above 800 \si{\degreeCelsius} are \ce{Na2MoO4}(l) + \ce{MoO3}(l), More discussion should follow $\ldots$.


%\subsubsection{Phase evolution probing by Raman}

\citeauthor{Hardcastle1990} summarized an empirical formula to relate the Raman peaks and \ce{Mo-O} bonding lengths.\cite{Hardcastle1990} This correlation assumes general form as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mobond}
\nu = A \exp{B\cdot R},
\end{equation}
where $A=32895$ and $B=-2.073$ are fitting parameters, R is bond distance in unit of \AA. Given a stretching frequency, the resolution for calculated bond distance is $\pm0.016$ \AA. Another empirical expression connect the bond valence $s$ and bond distance R: $s(M-O) \approx (R/X)^{-6} $, where X=1.882 when M is Mo, and 1.904 when M is W. The valence sum rule could be then used to check the state of Mo cation. It should be noticed that not all observed Raman lines could be correlated to a \ce{Mo-O} bond distance by extrapolation of Eq.~\ref{eq:mobond}. It is then regarded as a symmetry related vibrational mode, i.e. 820 \si{cm^{-1} in \ce{MoO3}. From the correlation of various Mo compounds, a general conclusion is the lower the stretching frequency for the shortest metal-oxygen bond, the more regular is the structure.

Nanotower is a less common morphology in the structures of nanomaterials.\cite{Kharissova2010} We have not found report on  \ce{MoO3} nanotower structures, although there are several studies on \ce{In2O3},\cite{Jean2010,Yan2007}, GaN\cite{Xiao2012} and ZnO\cite{Zhang2013c}. \citeauthor{Jean2010} investigated the growth mechanism of \ce{In2O3} nanotowers and attributed it to the periodical axial and continuous lateral growth interaction, where the former was first guided by Au-In alloy liquid, and subsequent by self-catalytic In droplets (MP 156C) while the latter due to VS process. In contrast, \citeauthor{Yan2007} observed similar \ce{In2O3} nanotower growth and proposed that the axial growth is controlled by Au-catalytic VLS process. \citeauthor{Xiao2012} reported the GaN nanotower grown on Ni-coated Si(111) substrates and explained the growth as asymmetric self-copy process based on VLS mechanism. \citeauthor{Zhang2013c} studied the growth of ZnO nanotower and provided a competitive model between axial and lateral growth controlled by Zn vapor to explain the as-synthesized structures. (When ZnO and carbon mixture was used as source instead of ZnO alone, nanorods array results, presumably due to the stable supply of Zn vapor owing to the gentle carbothermal reduction.) Therefore the fluctuation of reagents is probably responsible for tapering and periodical modification, which is absent in the coin roll style growth of \ce{MoO3} tower on Si. The occasionally observed tapering or enlarging on \ce{MoO3} tower can be attributed to the cooling down growth.

We divide the growth into two stages according to the emerging time of long belts and towers. In first stage the growth is dominated by lateral growth, as illustrated in . In the second stage, \ce{NaxMoO3} is evaporated and recondensed in the low temperature region, and some droplet will form, and when at proper locations, introduce secondary VLS growth.

In first stage, the Na-Mo-O liquid is formed and have much more higher absorption rate than that of bare substrate. The absorbed species will diffuse along the surface and inside the liquid. It was difficult to estimate which diffusion path one is faster. 


\textbf{open questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Is the liquid consumed? if so, how? : evaporation
\item How the size of liquid is related to the morphology evolution?
\item Possible doping level of alkaline ions
\item other lateral growth mode such as Ni-W-S system
\item VLS-VS interaction, or possible solution-liquid-solid, VSS,
\item the interpretation of phase diagram
\item the overall molar amount of NaOH and MoO3 deposition
\item Young's parameters, contact angle informations, Gibbs free energy calculation
\item catalyst composition variation during growth
\item \ce{Na2Mo4O_{13}} phases, solid solubility of \ce{Na2MoO4} in solid \ce{MoO3} is high.
\item vapor pressure of \ce{Na2Mo4O_{13}} and \ce{MoO3}.
\end{itemize}


As shown in Fig, we found several solid clusters with diameter about 1 $\mu m$ on the top part of long belts. According to the \ce{Na2MoO4}-\ce{MoO3} binary compounds phase diagram, we expect the terminating solid clusters have a Na:Mo ratio close to 0.6. The experimental results match well with this predictions. EDX analysis reveal the presence of Na on the solid cluster but not at about 1$\mu m$ away from previous location.\footnote{the sensitivity of our instrument is estimated to be 1\% atomic level} Quantitative atomic ratio derived from the solid cluster is not close to the one predicted by phase diagram probably due to the high Mo content in adjacent area. However, XRD examinations on a short time growth sample revealed a possible \ce{Na2Mo4O13} phase(PDF 028-1112), providing an indirection evidence of the droplet composition. We also suspect that the growth will become different below 500 \si{\degreeCelsius} since no liquid would remain. Substrate placed at low temp end show.
We can also deduce that other sodium compounds can be employed as substrate treatment agent. This argument is confirmed by \ce{Na2CO3} and \ce{KI} assisted growth.
