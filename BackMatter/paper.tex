\section{WO3}

An empirical formula to relate the Raman peaks and \ce{W-O} bonding lengths \cite{Hardcastle1995} is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:wobond}
\nu = 25823 \exp{-1.902\cdot R}.
\end{equation}
And the standard deviation of estimating \ce{W-O} bond distance from Raman stretching wavenumber is $\pm0.034$\AA.
The observed Raman peaks of \ce{Na5W_{14}O_{44}} phase lies at 965, 943, 913, 808, 786, 778, 765, 695 and 107 cm. Multi-peaks Lorentzian fitting is preformed to precisely determine the central maximum. Good fitting is obtained, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:naworamfit}. We then calculated \ce{W-O} bond distance using Eq.~\ref{eq:wobond}, as illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:nawobond}. The predicted \ce{W-O} bond length comply very well with the crystallographic value of \ce{Na5W_{14}O_{44}} phase.\cite{Triantafyllou1999a} The 107 peak probably is caused by \ce{Na-O} bond.

\ce{WOx} and optical electric field enhancement. The enhancement arise from the structure composed of a conductive layer and an insulating layer that are laminated therein.\footnote{US patent 8601610B2} In \ce{WOx} nanorods, the oxygen deficient planes are conductive, each having atomic thickness and separated by several nm \ce{WO3}. Localized surface plasmons could possibly exist on these conductive planes. Therefore SERS applies and single molecule Raman scattering using a tungsten oxide nanorod has been demonstrated. The \ce{W_n_O{3n-1}} ($n \geq 2$) exhibit $\{ 001 \}$ CS structure. Chemical formulae corresponding to n=2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are \ce{W2O5=WO_{2.5}}, \ce{W3O8=W_{2.67}}, \ce{W4O_{11}=WO_{2.75}}, \ce{W5O_{14}=WO_{2.8}}, and \ce{W6O_{17}=WO_{2.83}}, which indicates the existence of a oxygen deficient plane at every n row. Actually the value x in \ce{WOx} could almost continuously vary within a range of 2.5 to 3. \ce{W_{18}O_{49}=\ce{WO_{2.72}}} is an exception without $\{ 001 \}$ CS structure. Moreover, the oxygen deficient planes could extend along directions other than $\{ 001 \}$. For instance, the $\{ 102 \}$ CS planes appears in \ce{WOx} where x is within 2.93 to 2.98, and  the $\{ 103 \}$ CS planes for x within 2.87 to 2.93. \citeauthor{Shingaya2013} also synthesized \ce{WS2}-\ce{WO_x} structures and found similar Raman scattering enhancement. The x value is estimated by the Raman spectra peaks.\cite{Shingaya2013}(Data not shown in patent)

The Raman spectra of \ce{WO_x} is rare because of the difficulty of preparing pure suboxides phase and the strong shielding of \ce{WS2}. Yet it does exhibit distinct Raman spectra. \cite{Tenne2005} The 870 line is attributed to \ce{W3O8}.\cite{Hardcastle1995}

 For photochemical water reduction to occur, the flat-band potential of the semiconductor (for highly doped semiconductors, this equals the bottom of the conductance band) must exceed the proton reduction potential of 0.0 V vs NHE at pH =0. \cite{Osterloh2008} flat-band potentials strongly depend on ion absorption (protonation of surface hydroxyl groups), crystallographic orientation of the exposed surface, surface defects, and surface oxidation processes.

\section{MoO3}

\citeauthor{Hardcastle1990} summarized an empirical formula to relate the Raman peaks and \ce{Mo-O} bonding lengths.\cite{Hardcastle1990} This correlation assumes general form as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mobond}
\nu = A \exp{B\cdot R},
\end{equation}
where $A=32895$ and $B=-2.073$ are fitting parameters, R is bond distance in unit of \AA. Given a stretching frequency, the resolution for calculated bond distance is $\pm0.016$\AA. The counterpart for \ce{W-O} bond \cite{Hardcastle1995} is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:wobond}
\nu = 25823 \exp{-1.902\cdot R},
\end{equation}
with standard deviation of estimating \ce{W-O} bond distance from Raman stretching wavenumber is $\pm0.034$\AA. Another empirical expression connect the bond valence $s$ and bond distance R: $s(M-O) \approx (R/X)^{-6} $, where X=1.882 when M is Mo, and 1.904 when M is W. The valence sum rule could be then used to check the state of Mo cation. It should be noticed that not all observed Raman lines could be correlated to a \ce{Mo-O} bond distance by extrapolation of Eq.~\ref{eq:mobond}. It is then regarded as a symmetry related vibrational mode, i.e. $820 cm^{-1}$ in \ce{MoO3}. From the correlation of various Mo compounds, a general conclusion is the lower the stretching frequency for the shortest metal-oxygen bond, the more regular is the structure.



The molecular unit in crystal exhibits different vibrational frequencies from that in solution or gas phases.

Electrical transport measurements yield an highly anisotropic ratio of DC conductivities of 1:10:1000. Along this high conducting axis, metallic reflection behavior is confirmed by optical measurements. Therefore, this blue bronze \ce{K_{0.3}MoO3} is known as quasi-1D metal.\cite{Sing1999}

\ce{MoO3}, an alternative interpretation in terms of tetrahedral coordination of Mo atoms is also proposed. This is caused by the fact that four of the six surrounding O atom are at distances from 1.67\AA to 1.95\AA, while the remaining two are as far as 2.25 and 2.33\AA. This also stress that the \ce{MOO6} octahedra are rather distorted.

multipeak Lorentzian fitting. 270 to 410 cm

Raman technique could provide valuable insight into the structures of CNT, i.e., tube diameter by assigning the RBMs (radial breathing modes) and G peaks position.\cite{Bonaccorso2013}

 Raman spectroscopy qualifies as an excellent tool to monitor tensile tests of TMDs, both in 2D and in tubular forms.
For 2D materials, strain may be induced by elongation of an appropriate substrate, e.g. by uniform mechanical strain, or by using a material with high thermal expansion coefficient and varying the temperature. For TMD MWNT, tensile tests have been reported by various groups. However, to date, it is not perfectly clear whether inner and outer walls are stretched simultaneously, or rather the outer walls slide on the inner ones. The latter hypothesis would result in a broadening of the Raman signals, while the first one would leave the signal widths rather unaffected. In any case, there would be a shift of the Raman signals that can serve as precise scale for determining the strain.

As the experimental setup for direct tensile tests of nanotubes is state-of-the-art,\cite{Tang2013} the application of tensile stress on 2D TMD systems is rather difficult due to the excellent lubricating properties of these materials.

\citeauthor{Zhang2013i} investigated the shear (C) and layer breathing mode (LBM) in the low frequency region of \ce{MoS2}.\cite{Zhang2013i} Even layer \ce{MS2} belong to point group D$_{6h}$ with inversion symmetry, while odd layer \ce{MS2} correspond to D$_{3h}$ without inversion symmetry. The excitation wavelength is 532nm from a diode-pumped solid-state laser. A power$\sim$0.23mW is used to avoid sample heating.

\citeauthor{Cao2014} studied the layer-dependence \ce{MoS2} electrocatalysis and propose the vertical hopping efficiency of electrons instead of the edge site numbers is a key factor for catalytic reaction.\cite{Cao2014} ref19,20


(Shi, Pan, Zhang, \& Yakobson, 2013) studied the strained monolayer \ce{MoS2} and WS2. The results show that exciton binding energy is insensitive to the strain, while optical band gap becomes smaller as strain increases. Monolayer WS2 PL maximum located at about 1.95eV. Calculation shows the electron effective mass of WS2 is the smallest, rendering higher mobility in device.

Band structure  of \ce{MoS2} in bulk form was calculated by (Mattheiss, 1973). There is some controversy about the exact value of bandgap. The calculation result is 1.2eV ( indirect gap).\cite{Mattheiss1973}

(Zhou et al., 2010) heterojunction is employed to transferred photo-generated carriers. schottky barrier conduction band electron trapping and consequent longer electron-hole pair lifetimes. Numerous studies have suggested that fine particles of transition metals or their oxides, when dispersed on the surface of a photocatalyst matrix, can act as electron traps on n-type semiconductors.
