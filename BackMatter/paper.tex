\section{WO3}

The energetic sources are ion bombardment, electron beam, laser ablation, and combustion flame\cite{Rao2011}.

The solâ€“gel process is a well-known, intensively studied wetchemical technique that is widely used in materials synthesis. This method generally starts with a precursor solution (the ``sol") to form discrete particles or a networked gel structure. During the course of gelation (aging process), various forms of hydrolysis and polycondensation take place.
In addition, doped \ce{WO3} was also demonstrated

 The composition and phase of final product highly depend on the synthesis conditions.

 
Tungsten bronzes was coined by Wohler in 1837.\cite{Deb2008} \ce{Na_{x}WO3}

\citeauthor{Chatten2005} also studied the oxygen vacancy in different phases of \ce{WO3}.\cite{Chatten2005}

Nonstoichiometric tungsten oxides \ce{WO_x} (i.e. \ce{WO_{2.92}}, \ce{WO_{2.87}}) are known as Magn$\acute{e}$li phases.

We do not discuss tungsten oxide hydrates (\ce{WO3.nH2O}) in this work since the product of thermal CVD approach is not plagued with this complexity. It's necessary, however, to deal with hydrated \ce{WO3} in the liquid synthesis routes, as indicated in Section.~\ref{sec:woxgrowth}.

Theoretical computation of electronic band structures for \ce{WO_x} proves difficult due to the aforementioned phase transition. oxygen deficiency, structure change, electronic properties vary according.

the ubiquity of \ce{WO6} octahedra is essential for not only the optical properties but the ability to insert and extract ions in the EC oxides, due to the tunnels in three dimensions serving as path for transport of small ions. The intercalation of hydrogen or alkali ions into \ce{WO3} created electron donor level. By absorbing the red part of incident spectrum, electrons at donor level make transition to the conduction band, causing the blue coloration in \ce{H_xWO3}.

\citeauthor{Wang2009a} mentioned that amorphous \ce{WO3} can only be used in lithium-based electrolytes due to its
in-compact structure and high dissolution rate in acidic electrolyte solutions. Electrochromic materials that can endure acidic electrolytes without degradation should be developed. Crystalline \ce{WO3} nanostructures with their much denser structures and small particle sizes are promising to be used as suitable electrochromic material in acidic electrolytes.

Characterization of ECD (work like a thin-film batteries) includes transmission measurement and associated EC calculation, charge-discharge time, current-time curve and the fitting of obtained data.

The coloration efficiency (CE) represents the change in the optical density (OD) per unit charge density ($Q/A$, in units of \si{\cm^2\per\coulomb}) during switching and can be calculated according to the formula:
\begin{equation}
CE = \frac{\Delta~OD}{(Q/A)} [cm^2/C],
\end{equation}
where OD = $log(T_{bleach}/T_{color})$. The EC and optical density depend on the wavelength and are usually higher in the near IR than in the visible region.
Using Ohm's law($U_s = IR = RQ/t_s$) with switch voltage $U_s$, resistance R and surface area A, switching time $t_s$ could be estimated as
\begin{equation}
t_s = \Delta~OD\cdot A \cdot R /(CE\cdot U_s).
\end{equation}

its one dimensional (1D) nanostructure has attained intensive research efforts in recent years due to the potential applications in advanced nano-electric and nano-optoelectronic devices.

DFT doped \ce{WO3} for photocatalytic reaction.\cite{Wang2012} CBM arises from W $5d$ states and splits into $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ states under crystal field. VBM comes from O $2p$ states, including $2p_\sigma$ (along \ce{W-O} bonds) and $2p_\pi$ (normal to \ce{W-O} bonds).

oxygen vacancies in \ce{WO_{3-x}}.\cite{Wang2011b}  Coloration and electron conductivity changes. \citeauthor{Wang2011b} found strong dependence of WO3-x electronic properties on $V_O$ concentration and the the crystallographic direction on which O is removed. DFT band gap calculation is close to experimental value. Vacancy levels are found at 2.1eV.



W plasma oxidation.\cite{Romanyuk2005} 200nm W coating on Si (100) sub, temperature at RT, 390, and 490 C, oxygen pressure 0.5 Pa, oxidation time for 10 sec to 3600 sec. The resultant thickness of \ce{WO3} at RT  and time of 10 sec and 3600 sec is found to be 0.2nm and 11 nm respectively.

\[
 d = d_0 exp(kt)
\]

after fitting, $d_0 = 0.19777 nm$, $k = 0.00112 sec^{-1}$, so to oxidize 1nm W coating completely, oxygen plasma time is 1450 sec at 0.5Pa partially pressure; 2 nm for 2000 sec.

\ce{WOx} and optical electric field enhancement. The enhancement arise from the structure composed of a conductive layer and an insulating layer that are laminated therein.\footnote{US patent 8601610B2} In \ce{WOx} nanorods, the oxygen deficient planes are conductive, each having atomic thickness and separated by several nm \ce{WO3}. Localized surface plasmons could possibly exist on these conductive planes. Therefore SERS applies and single molecule Raman scattering using a tungsten oxide nanorod has been demonstrated. The \ce{W_nO_{3n-1}} ($n \geq 2$) exhibit $\{ 001 \}$ CS structure. Chemical formulae corresponding to n=2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are \ce{W2O5=WO_{2.5}}, \ce{W3O8=W_{2.67}}, \ce{W4O_{11}=WO_{2.75}}, \ce{W5O_{14}=WO_{2.8}}, and \ce{W6O_{17}=WO_{2.83}}, which indicates the existence of a oxygen deficient plane at every n row. Actually the value x in \ce{WOx} could almost continuously vary within a range of 2.5 to 3. \ce{W_{18}O_{49}=\ce{WO_{2.72}}} is an exception without $\{ 001 \}$ CS structure. Moreover, the oxygen deficient planes could extend along directions other than $\{ 001 \}$. For instance, the $\{ 102 \}$ CS planes appears in \ce{WOx} where x is within 2.93 to 2.98, and  the $\{ 103 \}$ CS planes for x within 2.87 to 2.93.\cite{Sloan1999}  \citeauthor{Shingaya2013} also synthesized \ce{WS2}-\ce{WO_x} structures and found similar Raman scattering enhancement. The x value is estimated by the Raman spectra peaks.\cite{Shingaya2013}(Data not shown in patent)

The Raman spectra of \ce{WO_x} is rare because of the difficulty of preparing pure suboxides phase and the strong shielding of \ce{WS2}. Yet it does exhibit distinct Raman spectra. \cite{Tenne2005} The 870 line is attributed to \ce{W3O8}.\cite{Hardcastle1995}

\citeauthor{Huang2006} studied the \ce{W3On} cluster with n from 7 to 10.\cite{Huang2006} It was found \ce{W3O9} clusters possess a HOMO-LUMO gap about 3.4eV. This closeness to bulk value suggests \ce{W3O9} could be viewed as the smallest molecular unit for bulk \ce{WO3}.

For photochemical water reduction to occur, the flat-band potential of the semiconductor (for highly doped semiconductors, this equals the bottom of the conductance band) must exceed the proton reduction potential of 0.0 V vs NHE at pH =0. \cite{Osterloh2008} flat-band potentials strongly depend on ion absorption (protonation of surface hydroxyl groups), crystallographic orientation of the exposed surface, surface defects, and surface oxidation processes.

\citeauthor{Salje1984} studied the transport in \ce{WO_{3-x}} ($0\leq x \leq 0.28$).\cite{Salje1984} It was found \ce{WO_{3-x}} show metallic conductivity when $x > 0.1$.

An empirical formula to relate the Raman peaks and \ce{W-O} bonding lengths \cite{Hardcastle1995} is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:wobond}
\nu = 25823 \exp{-1.902\cdot R}.
\end{equation}
And the standard deviation of estimating \ce{W-O} bond distance from Raman stretching wavenumber is $\pm0.034$\AA.
The observed Raman peaks of \ce{Na5W_{14}O_{44}} phase lies at 965, 943, 913, 808, 786, 778, 765, 695 and 107 cm. Multi-peaks Lorentzian fitting is preformed to precisely determine the central maximum. Good fitting is obtained, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:naworamfit}. We then calculated \ce{W-O} bond distance using Eq.~\ref{eq:wobond}, as illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:nawobond}. The predicted \ce{W-O} bond length comply very well with the crystallographic value of \ce{Na5W_{14}O_{44}} phase.\cite{Triantafyllou1999a} The 107 peak probably is caused by \ce{Na-O} bond.

\citeauthor{Sella1998} studied the optical and structural properties of RF sputtered thin film of \ce{WO3} and \ce{VO2} for electrochromic devices. Ionic conductor was built using transparent polymer electrolyte, which was prepared from a solution of 1M \ce{LiClO4} in propylene carbonate which was mixed with methylmetharcylate (MMA). The main characteristics of polymer electrolyte were: viscosity at 25 \si{\degreeCelsius} $\approx$ 12920 Pa.s, conductivity $\approx 10^{-2}-10^{-4}$\si{\per\ohm\per cm},non-hygroscopic if PMMA concentration \textgreater 30\%. A specific counter-electrode layer was not used since the encapsulated polymer electrolyte processes a very high ion storage capacity.\cite{Sella1998}

\subsection{strain}

$E_{2g}$ mode is strain sensitive. 

\citeauthor{Ghorbani-Asl2013} studied the strain in tubular TMDC and found a linear dependence of Raman scattering on strain (3 \si{cm^{-1}} per percentage for $E_{2g}$mode).\cite{Ghorbani-Asl2013} 

\citeauthor{Virsek2007} performed a Raman-TEM integrated study on multiwalled \ce{WS2} NT with diameter \textgreater 200 nm. The tubes were synthesized using chemical transport method. Up-shift of Raman is explained by strain in the walls. This shift is not observed in the specimen by sulfurization process of oxides. Applied hydrostatic pressure is isotropic,\cite{Staiger2012} while the strain is expected to anisotropic. Strain can also be relaxed by chirality.\cite{Virsek2007}

`` Nanotubes not fully converted appeared also during short
runs with higher working pressure. HRTEM observations
revealed an amorphous phase inside some of the nanotubesâ€™
hollow cores, generally near the nanotubes tip (Fig. 5a). The
amorphous phase occupies only a small fraction of the nanotubeâ€™s
core volume. A meniscus is found to form at the contact
point between the amorphous matter and the nanotubeâ€™s walls.
Fig. 5b displays such a meniscus in the nanotube core (marked
by arrows). The presence of this meniscus indicates that this
amorphous material solidified from a molten phase during the
cool-down period of the sample. The meniscus of the amorphous
phase suggest that the amorphous matter wets the
nanotubesâ€™ walls. Since the WS2 nanotubes are hydrophobic,
this observation indicates that a monomolecular layer of oxide
is left on the entire hollow core of the nanotubes. The nanotube
walls near the contact area with the meniscus are quite defective,
probably due to the large differences between the thermal
expansion coefficients of the WS2 and the amorphous matter,
which induces strain during the cool-down period of the
reaction product. These observations are consistent with the
notion that the amorphous material inside the core is an oxide
phase which is hydrophilic and does not wet the hydrophobic
WS2 layers''\cite{Margolin2004}

For 2D materials, strain may be induced by elongation of an appropriate substrate, e.g. by uniform mechanical strain, or by using a material with high thermal expansion coefficient and varying the temperature. For TMD MWNT, tensile tests have been reported by various groups. However, to date, it is not perfectly clear whether inner and outer walls are stretched simultaneously, or rather the outer walls slide on the inner ones. The latter hypothesis would result in a broadening of the Raman signals, while the first one would leave the signal widths rather unaffected. In any case, there would be a shift of the Raman signals that can serve as precise scale for determining the strain.

As the experimental setup for direct tensile tests of nanotubes is state-of-the-art,\cite{Tang2013} the application of tensile stress on 2D TMD systems is rather difficult due to the excellent lubricating properties of these materials.

MB is a heterocyclic aromatic dye which is blue colored in oxidizing environment. Upon reduction, MB is turned into colorless leuco MB. This can be used as an oxygen indicator in food industry. Photo-bleaching of MB can be also due to its leuco formation rather than total decomposition. Photocatalytic decomposition can be minimized by keeping the solution at acidic condition (PH = 4), which will limit the formation of oxidative hydroxyl radicals (E = 2.8eV vs normal hydrogen electrode). Oxygen dissolved in the solution play a key role in conversion of LMB to MB under visible light. Purging with \ce{N2} for 20mins can remove dissolved oxygen. \cite{Wang2014a}

common wisdom expect that a dye incapable of injecting an electron at the excited state to CdS. MB, which process N-methyl groups in its molecular structure and does not sensitize CdS is an exemplary candidate. quantum efficiency is defined as probability of MB converted to azure B per incident photon. QE of CdS to MB decomposition is reduced in nitrogen bubbling treated solutions, indicating the necessity of oxygen. Two possible mechanisms: a) adsorbed oxygen acts as a trap for the conduction electron and prevent the accumulation of negative charge within space charge region of CdS, supported by the formation of \ce{O2^-} in excitation of CdS in aqueous suspension.\cite{Takizawa1978}

which indicates the total oxidation of $10 \mu M$ MB would exhaust the ambient oxygen concentration of initially air-equilibrated solutions (about $250 \mu M$ ). ref 28 Thus the transport of both oxygen and MB to the photocatalyst surface are anticipated to be key factors.

photoelectrochromism at \ce{TiO2}/MB interface and its control. Efficient capture of photogenerated holes by a reducing agent is crucial to the reversibility of bleach-recoloration transition. This transition is kinetically dictated by electron transfer. Holes transfer is not desired.\cite{DeTacconi1997}

256 nm band is associated to the presence of LMB. LMB formation is not favored at alkaline pH values in aqueous solution. The OH radicals are generated either with the surface hydroxyl groups on \ce{TiO2} or with water, and its high oxidizing power cause photocatalytic decomposition of the dye.

An elementary step in decomposition of MB is N-dealkylation, which is preceded by radical cation formation.\cite{Takizawa1978} This radical cation can be spectroscopically monitored by the presence of 520nm band for MB. In MB absorption spectrum, 664 and 614 nm band ratio is related to monomer and dimer relaxation.
\begin{align}
\cee{TiO2 &\rightarrow e_{CB}^- + h_{VB}^+ \\

Measure the ratio between 614 and 663 nm before and after adding WS2 can indicate the adsorption of monomer and dimer MB.

MB can act as sacrificial electron acceptor in the reduction to leuco form. The decomposition is favored under oxygen-rich environment. MB feature peaks at 663, 614 and 292 nm, and $\epsilon_{660}=10^5 M^{-1}cm^{-1}$. The doubly reduced form of MB, LMB has feature peak at 256 nm.

\section{The physics of semiconductor}

quantum well devices exploit spatial quantization effects to increase the efficiency as well as alter the lasing threshold, and  novel semiconductor is made to emit light at wavelengths different from those possible when only bulk material is used.


The discontinuity in the CB and CB occurs at the interface. The corresponding potential discontinuity create a potential difference, forming a trap in which electron or hole can only have discrete energies.

a material of smaller bandgap is sandwiched between two layers of material of greater bandgap, or vice versa.

transmissivity coupled in multiple quantum well structure.

band structures=potential energy diagrams.

\textbf{junctions}
p-n homojunctions, p-n or n-n heterojunctions, metal-semi junctions, most important types: Schottky barriers, or ohmic contact.

chemical potential (Fermi level) as a measure of particle concentration.  Fermi level at 0K is equal to Fermi energy, which is defined as the energy of the topmost filled orbital. In equilibrium, the Fermi level $E_f$ is uniform throughout the material. n electron carrier, p holes carrier.

band diagram represents the electron's potential energy.

band bending: the electron energies are greater on the p side than on the n side, or the electrostatic potential is greater on the n side than on the p side, since potential $V = E/-q$.

The built-in potential for a homojunction is equal to the full band bending in equilibrium.

heterojunction: bandgap discontinuity, to solve the Poisson's equation for band bending.

Metal-Semi: metal cannot support any potential difference across it. Fermi level in Semi is pinned at the interface. Electron transfer from n-type semi to metal, leaving ionized donors behind.

ohmic contact forms if the work function of the metal is less than that of the semi. net flow of electron from metal into semi, no depletion layer forms.

metal-oxide-semi as MIS structures is capacitive in nature since no dc current flows under bias.
