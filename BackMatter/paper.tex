\section{WO3}

An empirical formula to relate the Raman peaks and \ce{W-O} bonding lengths \cite{Hardcastle1995} is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:wobond}
\nu = 25823 \exp{-1.902\cdot R}.
\end{equation}
And the standard deviation of estimating \ce{W-O} bond distance from Raman stretching wavenumber is $\pm0.034$\AA.
The observed Raman peaks of \ce{Na5W_{14}O_{44}} phase lies at 965, 943, 913, 808, 786, 778, 765, 695 and 107 cm. Multi-peaks Lorentzian fitting is preformed to precisely determine the central maximum. Good fitting is obtained, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:naworamfit}. We then calculated \ce{W-O} bond distance using Eq.~\ref{eq:wobond}, as illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:nawobond}. The predicted \ce{W-O} bond length comply very well with the crystallographic value of \ce{Na5W_{14}O_{44}} phase.\cite{Triantafyllou1999a} The 107 peak probably is caused by \ce{Na-O} bond.

\ce{WOx} and optical electric field enhancement. The enhancement arise from the structure composed of a conductive layer and an insulating layer that are laminated therein.\footnote{US patent 8601610B2} In \ce{WOx} nanorods, the oxygen deficient planes are conductive, each having atomic thickness and separated by several nm \ce{WO3}. Localized surface plasmons could possibly exist on these conductive planes. Therefore SERS applies and single molecule Raman scattering using a tungsten oxide nanorod has been demonstrated. The \ce{W_n_O{3n-1}} ($n \geq 2$) exhibit $\{ 001 \}$ CS structure. Chemical formulae corresponding to n=2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are \ce{W2O5=WO_{2.5}}, \ce{W3O8=W_{2.67}}, \ce{W4O_{11}=WO_{2.75}}, \ce{W5O_{14}=WO_{2.8}}, and \ce{W6O_{17}=WO_{2.83}}, which indicates the existence of a oxygen deficient plane at every n row. Actually the value x in \ce{WOx} could almost continuously vary within a range of 2.5 to 3. \ce{W_{18}O_{49}=\ce{WO_{2.72}}} is an exception without $\{ 001 \}$ CS structure. Moreover, the oxygen deficient planes could extend along directions other than $\{ 001 \}$. For instance, the $\{ 102 \}$ CS planes appears in \ce{WOx} where x is within 2.93 to 2.98, and  the $\{ 103 \}$ CS planes for x within 2.87 to 2.93. \citeauthor{Shingaya2013} also synthesized \ce{WS2}-\ce{WO_x} structures and found similar Raman scattering enhancement. The x value is estimated by the Raman spectra peaks.\cite{Shingaya2013}(Data not shown in patent)

The Raman spectra of \ce{WO_x} is rare because of the difficulty of preparing pure suboxides phase and the strong shielding of \ce{WS2}. Yet it does exhibit distinct Raman spectra. \cite{Tenne2005} The 870 line is attributed to \ce{W3O8}.\cite{Hardcastle1995}

 For photochemical water reduction to occur, the flat-band potential of the semiconductor (for highly doped semiconductors, this equals the bottom of the conductance band) must exceed the proton reduction potential of 0.0 V vs NHE at pH =0. \cite{Osterloh2008} flat-band potentials strongly depend on ion absorption (protonation of surface hydroxyl groups), crystallographic orientation of the exposed surface, surface defects, and surface oxidation processes.

\ce{MoO3}, an alternative interpretation in terms of tetrahedral coordination of Mo atoms is also proposed. This is caused by the fact that four of the six surrounding O atom are at distances from 1.67\AA to 1.95\AA, while the remaining two are as far as 2.25 and 2.33\AA. This also stress that the \ce{MOO6} octahedra are rather distorted.

In centrosymmetric crystals, the vibrational modes must either have even (Raman-active) or odd (IR-active) parity under inversion, which is known as rule of mutual exclusion. When this symmetry is broken, some modes may be simultaneously IR and Raman active.

inelastic neutron scattering to study the non-zone center LA mode. Zone-edge scattering can occur due to zone-folding process. The formation of superlattice could activate formerly inactive zone-edge phonons. The folding of BZ along $\Gamma-M$ would cause the M point to coincide with $\Gamma$ point, so LA(M) phonons would become Raman active in a first-order process.

For 2D materials, strain may be induced by elongation of an appropriate substrate, e.g. by uniform mechanical strain, or by using a material with high thermal expansion coefficient and varying the temperature. For TMD MWNT, tensile tests have been reported by various groups. However, to date, it is not perfectly clear whether inner and outer walls are stretched simultaneously, or rather the outer walls slide on the inner ones. The latter hypothesis would result in a broadening of the Raman signals, while the first one would leave the signal widths rather unaffected. In any case, there would be a shift of the Raman signals that can serve as precise scale for determining the strain.

As the experimental setup for direct tensile tests of nanotubes is state-of-the-art,\cite{Tang2013} the application of tensile stress on 2D TMD systems is rather difficult due to the excellent lubricating properties of these materials.

(Shi, Pan, Zhang, \& Yakobson, 2013) studied the strained monolayer \ce{MoS2} and WS2. The results show that exciton binding energy is insensitive to the strain, while optical band gap becomes smaller as strain increases. Monolayer WS2 PL maximum located at about 1.95eV. Calculation shows the electron effective mass of WS2 is the smallest, rendering higher mobility in device.

\cite{Wang2014a} MB is a heterocyclic aromatic dye which is blue colored in oxidizing environment. Upon reduction, MB is turned into colorless leuco MB. This can be used as an oxygen indicator in food industry. Photo-bleaching of MB can be also due to its leuco formation rather than total decomposition. Photocatalytic decomposition can be minimized by keeping the solution at acidic condition (PH = 4), which will limit the formation of oxidative hydroxyl radicals (E = 2.8eV vs normal hydrogen electrode). Oxygen dissolved in the solution play a key role in conversion of LMB to MB under visible light. Purging with \ce{N2} for 20mins can remove dissolved oxygen.

\cee{MB^+ H2O + H^+ \rightarrow MBH3^{2+} + 1/2O2}

where MB represents the uncharged center of MB molecule.

\cite{Takizawa1978} common wisdom expect that a dye incapable of injecting an electron at the excited state to CdS. MB, which process N-methyl groups in its molecular structure and does not sensitize CdS is an exemplary candidate. quantum efficiency is defined as probability of MB converted to azure B per incident photon. QE of CdS to MB decomposition is reduced in nitrogen bubbling treated solutions, indicating the necessity of oxygen. Two possible mechanisms: a) adsorbed oxygen acts as a trap for the conduction electron and prevent the accumulation of negative charge within space charge region of CdS, supported by the formation of \ce{O2^-} in excitation of CdS in aqueous suspension.

where $K = k_2 \phi N T_r$, with $\phi$ as quantum yield, N as total absorbed photons, and $T_r$ as rate of transport.
\[

which indicates the total oxidation of $10 \mu M$ MB would exhaust the ambient oxygen concentration of initially air-equilibrated solutions (about $250 \mu M$ ). ref 28 Thus the transport of both oxygen and MB to the photocatalyst surface are anticipated to be key factors.

\cite{DeTacconi1997} photoelectrochromism at \ce{TiO2}/MB interface and its control. Efficient capture of photogenerated holes by a reducing agent is crucial to the reversibility of bleach-recoloration transition. This transition is kinetically dictated by electron transfer. Holes transfer is not desired.

256 nm band is associated to the presence of LMB. LMB formation is not favored at alkaline pH values in aqueous solution. The OH radicals are generated either with the surface hydroxyl groups on \ce{TiO2} or with water, and its high oxidizing power cause photocatalytic decomposition of the dye.

An elementary step in decomposition of MB is N-dealkylation, which is preceded by radical cation formation.\cite{Takizawa1978} This radical cation can be spectroscopically monitored by the presence of 520nm band for MB. In MB absorption spectrum, 664 and 614 nm band ratio is related to monomer and dimer relaxation.
\begin{align}
\cee{TiO2 &\rightarrow e_{CB}^- + h_{VB}^+ \\
h_{VB}^+ + red &\rightarrow ox\\
MB^+ + 2e_{CB}^ + H^+ &\rightarrow LMB}
\end{align}

Measure the ratio between 614 and 663 nm before and after adding WS2 can indicate the adsorption of monomer and dimer MB.

\cite{Mills1999} MB can act as sacrificial electron acceptor in the reduction to leuco form. The decomposition is favored under oxygen-rich environment. MB feature peaks at 663, 614 and 292 nm, and $\epsilon_{660}=10^5 M^{-1}cm^{-1}$. The doubly reduced form of MB, LMB has feature peak at 256 nm. The singly reduced form of MB, \ce{MB.^-} is pale yellow, with peak at 420nm.
\[
\cee{MB + e_{CB}^- ->[pH<7] MB.^-}
\cee{2MB.^- \rightarrow MB + LMB}
\cee{O2 + e_{CB}^- \rightarrow O2.^-}
\]

The oxidized form of MB, \ce{MB.^+} has peak at 520nm, which is stable in acidic solution, but decomposes irreversibly in slight alkaline solution(pH = 9).
thionine peaks at 600nm.
MB forms dimers in aqueous solution,
\ce{
2MB <=>[K_D] (MB)_2

A typical value of $K_D$ is 3970 1/M. A quadratic equation can be solved to obtain the monomer concentration:
\[
2K_D [MB]^2 + [MB] - [MB]_{total} = 0
\]
MB adsorption on metal oxides. Monomer size is less than 1.5nm.
Logarithmic acid dissociation constant $pK_a= -\log_10 \frac{[A^-][H^+]}{[HA]}$. The oxidation potential for \ce{H2O}-\ce{O2} couple is 1.23V and 0.817V versus NHE at pH 0 and pH 7, respectively.
