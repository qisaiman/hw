\section{WO3}

\ce{WOx} and optical electric field enhancement. The enhancement arise from the structure composed of a conductive layer and an insulating layer that are laminated therein.\footnote{US patent 8601610B2} In \ce{WOx} nanorods, the oxygen deficient planes are conductive, each having atomic thickness and separated by several nm \ce{WO3}. Localized surface plasmons could possibly exist on these conductive planes. Therefore SERS applies and single molecule Raman scattering using a tungsten oxide nanorod has been demonstrated. The \ce{W_n_O{3n-1}} ($n \geq 2$) exhibit $\{ 001 \}$ CS structure. Chemical formulae corresponding to n=2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are \ce{W2O5=WO_{2.5}}, \ce{W3O8=W_{2.67}}, \ce{W4O_{11}=WO_{2.75}}, \ce{W5O_{14}=WO_{2.8}}, and \ce{W6O_{17}=WO_{2.83}}, which indicates the existence of a oxygen deficient plane at every n row. Actually the value x in \ce{WOx} could almost continuously vary within a range of 2.5 to 3. \ce{W_{18}O_{49}=\ce{WO_{2.72}}} is an exception without $\{ 001 \}$ CS structure. Moreover, the oxygen deficient planes could extend along directions other than $\{ 001 \}$. For instance, the $\{ 102 \}$ CS planes appears in \ce{WOx} where x is within 2.93 to 2.98, and  the $\{ 103 \}$ CS planes for x within 2.87 to 2.93. \citeauthor{Shingaya2013} also synthesized \ce{WS2}-\ce{WO_x} structures and found similar Raman scattering enhancement. The x value is estimated by the Raman spectra peaks.\cite{Shingaya2013}(Data not shown in patent)

The Raman spectra of \ce{WO_x} is rare because of the difficulty of preparing pure suboxides phase and the strong shielding of \ce{WS2}. Yet it does exhibit distinct Raman spectra. \cite{Tenne2005} The 870 line is attributed to \ce{W3O8}.\cite{Hardcastle1995}

\citeauthor{Huang2006} studied the \ce{W3On} cluster with n from 7 to 10.\cite{Huang2006} It was found \ce{W3O9} clusters possess a HOMO-LUMO gap about 3.4eV. This closeness to bulk value suggests \ce{W3O9} could be viewed as the smallest molecular unit for bulk \ce{WO3}.

 For photochemical water reduction to occur, the flat-band potential of the semiconductor (for highly doped semiconductors, this equals the bottom of the conductance band) must exceed the proton reduction potential of 0.0 V vs NHE at pH =0. \cite{Osterloh2008} flat-band potentials strongly depend on ion absorption (protonation of surface hydroxyl groups), crystallographic orientation of the exposed surface, surface defects, and surface oxidation processes.

\citeauthor{Salje1984} studied the transport in \ce{WO_{3-x}} ($0\leq x \leq 0.28$).\cite{Salje1984} It was found \ce{WO_{3-x}} show metallic conductivity when $x > 0.1$.

For the photodegradation method, it was stated that `` the samples were collected after the photoreaction had been centrifuged for 5 min to remove the photocatalyst before UV-Vis measurement.''


\section{MoO3}

\citeauthor{Hardcastle1990} summarized an empirical formula to relate the Raman peaks and \ce{Mo-O} bonding lengths.\cite{Hardcastle1990} This correlation assumes general form as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mobond}
\nu = A \exp{B\cdot R},
\end{equation}
where $A=32895$ and $B=-2.073$ are fitting parameters, R is bond distance in unit of \AA. Given a stretching frequency, the resolution for calculated bond distance is $\pm0.016$\AA. The counterpart for \ce{W-O} bond \cite{Hardcastle1995} is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:wobond}
\nu = 25823 \exp{-1.902\cdot R},
\end{equation}
with standard deviation of estimating \ce{W-O} bond distance from Raman stretching wavenumber is $\pm0.034$\AA. Another empirical expression connect the bond valence $s$ and bond distance R: $s(M-O) \approx (R/X)^{-6} $, where X=1.882 when M is Mo, and 1.904 when M is W. The valence sum rule could be then used to check the state of Mo cation. It should be noticed that not all observed Raman lines could be correlated to a \ce{Mo-O} bond distance by extrapolation of Eq.~\ref{eq:mobond}. It is then regarded as a symmetry related vibrational mode, i.e. $820 cm^{-1}$ in \ce{MoO3}. From the correlation of various Mo compounds, a general conclusion is the lower the stretching frequency for the shortest metal-oxygen bond, the more regular is the structure.

The observed raman lines of \ce{Na5W_{14}O_{44}} phase lies at 965, 943, 913, 808, 786, 778, 765, 695 and 107 cm. The calculated \ce{W-O} bond distance using Eq.~\ref{eq:wobond} fit very well with the crystallographic value of \ce{Na5W_{14}O_{44}}. \cite{Triantafyllou1999a} The 107 peak probably arise from \ce{Na-O} bond.

The molecular unit in crystal exhibits different vibrational frequencies from that in solution or gas phases.

In 2H type TMDC, the $A_{1g}$ mode is sensitive to electrostatic doping, while $E_{2g}^1$ mode is sensitive to strain, in which the FWHM of the peaks are indicator of external force quantity.

Raman technique could provide valuable insight into the structures of CNT, i.e., tube diameter by assigning the RBMs (radial breathing modes) and G peaks position.\cite{Bonaccorso2013}

(Shi, Pan, Zhang, \& Yakobson, 2013) studied the strained monolayer \ce{MoS2} and WS2. The results show that exciton binding energy is insensitive to the strain, while optical band gap becomes smaller as strain increases. Monolayer WS2 PL maximum located at about 1.95eV. Calculation shows the electron effective mass of WS2 is the smallest, rendering higher mobility in device.

Band structure  of \ce{MoS2} in bulk form was calculated by (Mattheiss, 1973). There is some controversy about the exact value of bandgap. The calculation result is 1.2eV ( indirect gap).\cite{Mattheiss1973}

Alkali metal intercalated \ce{WS2} film was prepared.(Homyonfer et al., 1997) Stage 6 superlattice formation was suggested according to X-ray diffraction, and photoresponse spectra and electron tunneling measurement were done.

(Splendiani et al., 2010) reported the PL in monolayer \ce{MoS2}.  Calculation indicated the indirect gap become larger when thinning, while the previous direct one almost stays as the same, the value is about 1.85eV (direct gap).\cite{Splendiani2010}

(Zhou et al., 2010) heterojunction is employed to transferred photo-generated carriers. schottky barrier conduction band electron trapping and consequent longer electron-hole pair lifetimes. Numerous studies have suggested that fine particles of transition metals or their oxides, when dispersed on the surface of a photocatalyst matrix, can act as electron traps on n-type semiconductors.
