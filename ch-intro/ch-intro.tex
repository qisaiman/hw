\chapter{introduction: nanomaterials for energy applications}

\section{Background and Motivation}

TMO as electrochromic device and TMDC as newly 2D semiconductor, and some VLS.

Materials that human can make define the age they live in. From Stone Age to Bronze Age and Iron Age, people evolve as mastering more and more sophisticated techniques of manipulating metals, such as alloying and annealing. Obtaining extreme high purity of silicon brings us into Information Age. Future is difficult to predict. But nanotechnology is one direction that we can not ignore. According to \gls{nni}, \gls{nanotechnology}. This definition alludes that dimension comes before compositions. It is often related to the quantum confinement or surface area in nanomaterials, which we will later revisit with specific scenario.

There are three states of matter under usual conditions: solid,liquid and gas. Solids materials could be further categorized into five groups: metals, ceramics, polymers, semiconductors, and composites.\cite{William2009} This classification is based on both composition and mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties as well as the associated functionality(i.e., \gls{ceramics} are typically hard yet brittle, insulating to electricity and resistant to heating).

\section{Dissertation Outline}

The materials studied in this work/dissertation are tungsten oxides (\ce{WO3}), molybdenum oxides (\ce{MoO3}),and their chalcogenide counterparts (\ce{WS2} and \ce{MoS2}). Both tungsten (W) and molybdenum (Mo) belong to Group VIB transition metal, with outer shell electrons configuration as $4d^55s^1$ and $5d^46s^2$ respectively. Therefore we refer their oxides and chalcogenides as \gls{tmo} and \gls{tmdc}.\footnote{Obviously transition metals include many other elements, all of which have partially filled $d$-electron shell. But here we use TM to denote W and Mo exclusively.} We have synthesized \gls{tmo} and \gls{tmdc} at nanoscale, measured their crystalline structures and optical properties and demonstrated some devices assembled using as-synthesized nanomaterials. We aim to illustrate that by nanoengineering these \gls{tmo} and \gls{tmdc}, enhanced performances over their bulk states could be expected and new properties will arise. In the remaining sections of this chapter, we will discuss some general perspectives of nanomaterials, the growth apparatus and characterization methods that apply to all experiments done in this work. Then chapter 2 will focus on growth of \ce{WO3} and its derivative. We employed thermal \gls{cvd} to synthesize \ce{WO3} \gls{nw}, and we investigated the role of impurity in tungsten metallic powders, during which we observed a new state of sodium tungsten oxides: \ce{Na5W14O44} nanowires. We also found a method to potentially obtain large yield of \ce{WO3} \gls{nw}. Chapter 3 will concentrate on \ce{MoO3}. We explored two different growth mechanism of \ce{MoO3}:\gls{vs} and \gls{vls}. We discovered that alkaline oxides can be used as catalyst to grow two distinct \ce{MoO3} morphologies: nanobelts and towers. We further demonstrated the application of as-synthesized \ce{MoO3} nanomaterials in electrochromic devices.  In chapter 4 we discuss the growth of \gls{tmdc} and associated heterostructures. We synthesized \ce{WO3}-\ce{WS2} core-shell \gls{nw} and inspected the growth of \gls{fl} \ce{WS2}. Chapter 5 will conclude with an overall summary.



\section{Nanomaterials for Energy Applications}

why nano? surface-to-volume ratio, more surface area for catalytic reaction; surface energy state: tuned by dimension; quantum confinement effects: exciton size vs physical dimension. easy for dopant diffusion, thereby band structure modification; charge-separation and transport mechanism may also differ from bulk.


\section{Crystal Structures and Electronic Properties}

Solid and orderliness.




Two theories arise to describe the outer shell electrons and to correlate the structure and physical properties: \gls{cft} and band theory.\cite{Goodenough1971} \gls{cft} assumes weak interaction between neighboring atoms and localization of electron towards parent atom, whereas band theory assumes that electron is shared equally by all nuclei and therefore a many-electron problems follows. Description of a single electron in periodic potential fail to treat the electron correlations adequately, as the interaction between atoms becomes weaker.For transition metals, $s$ and $p$ electrons are well described by a collective-electron model, while the 4f or 5f electrons are tightly bound to nuclei and screened from the neighboring atoms by 5s, 5p or 6s, 6p core electrons, hence it matches well with a localized-electron model. d electrons show intermediate character.

\section{Growth Apparatus and Characterization Methods}
\subsection{CVD System}



Nucleation is a process of generating a new phase from a metastable old phase, where the Gibbs energy per molecule of the bulk of the emerging new phase is less than that of the old phase.
