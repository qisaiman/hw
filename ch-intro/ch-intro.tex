\chapter{introduction: nanomaterials for energy applications}

\section{Background and Motivation}

TMO as electrochromic device and TMDC as newly 2D semiconductor, and some VLS.

Materials that human can make define the age they live in. From Stone Age to Bronze Age and Iron Age, people evolve as mastering more and more sophisticated techniques of manipulating metals, such as alloying and annealing. Obtaining extreme high purity of silicon brings us into Information Age. Future is difficult to predict. But nanotechnology is one direction that we can not ignore. According to \gls{nni}, \gls{nanotechnology}. This definition alludes that dimension comes before compositions. It is often related to the quantum confinement or surface area in nanomaterials, which we will later revisit with specific scenario.

There are three states of matter under usual conditions: solid,liquid and gas. Solids materials could be further categorized into five groups: metals, ceramics, polymers, semiconductors, and composites.\cite{William2009} This classification is based on both composition and mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties as well as the associated functionality(i.e., \gls{ceramics} are typically hard yet brittle, insulating to electricity and resistant to heating).

\section{Dissertation Outline}

The materials studied in this work/dissertation are tungsten oxides (\ce{WO3}), molybdenum oxides (\ce{MoO3}),and their chalcogenide counterparts (\ce{WS2} and \ce{MoS2}). Both tungsten (W) and molybdenum (Mo) belong to Group VIB transition metal, with outer shell electrons configuration as $4d^55s^1$ and $5d^46s^2$ respectively. Therefore we refer their oxides and chalcogenides as \gls{tmo} and \gls{tmdc}.\footnote{Obviously transition metals include many other elements, all of which have partially filled $d$-electron shell. But here we use TM to denote W and Mo exclusively.} We have synthesized \gls{tmo} and \gls{tmdc} at nanoscale, measured their crystalline structures and optical properties and demonstrated some devices assembled using as-synthesized nanomaterials. We aim to illustrate that by nanoengineering these \gls{tmo} and \gls{tmdc}, enhanced performances over their bulk states could be expected and new properties will arise. In the remaining sections of this chapter, we will discuss some general perspectives of nanomaterials, the growth apparatus and characterization methods that apply to all experiments done in this work. Then chapter 2 will focus on growth of \ce{WO3} and its derivative. We employed thermal \gls{cvd} to synthesize \ce{WO3} \gls{nw}, and we investigated the role of impurity in tungsten metallic powders, during which we observed a new state of sodium tungsten oxides: \ce{Na5W14O44} nanowires. We also found a method to potentially obtain large yield of \ce{WO3} \gls{nw}. Chapter 3 will concentrate on \ce{MoO3}. We explored two different growth mechanism of \ce{MoO3}:\gls{vs} and \gls{vls}. We discovered that alkaline oxides can be used as catalyst to grow two distinct \ce{MoO3} morphologies: nanobelts and towers. We further demonstrated the application of as-synthesized \ce{MoO3} nanomaterials in electrochromic devices.  In chapter 4 we discuss the growth of \gls{tmdc} and associated heterostructures. We synthesized \ce{WO3}-\ce{WS2} core-shell \gls{nw} and inspected the growth of \gls{fl} \ce{WS2}. Chapter 5 will conclude with an overall summary.



\section{Nanomaterials for Energy Applications}

why nano? surface-to-volume ratio, more surface area for catalytic reaction; surface energy state: tuned by dimension; quantum confinement effects: exciton size vs physical dimension. easy for dopant diffusion, thereby band structure modification; charge-separation and transport mechanism may also differ from bulk.


\section{Crystal Structures and Electronic Properties}

Solid and orderliness.




Two theories arise to describe the outer shell electrons and to correlate the structure and physical properties: \gls{cft} and band theory.\cite{Goodenough1971} \gls{cft} assumes weak interaction between neighboring atoms and localization of electron towards parent atom, whereas band theory assumes that electron is shared equally by all nuclei and therefore a many-electron problems follows. Description of a single electron in periodic potential fail to treat the electron correlations adequately, as the interaction between atoms becomes weaker.For transition metals, $s$ and $p$ electrons are well described by a collective-electron model, while the 4f or 5f electrons are tightly bound to nuclei and screened from the neighboring atoms by 5s, 5p or 6s, 6p core electrons, hence it matches well with a localized-electron model. d electrons show intermediate character.

\section{Growth Apparatus and Characterization Methods}
\subsection{CVD System}

The synthesis was accomplished in a home-made hot-wall CVD system, as visualized in Fig.~\ref{fig:ch1cvd}. The furnace is made by two semi-cylindrical ceramic fiber heaters (WATLOW inc.) with power density from 0.8 to 4.6 \si{W/cm^2}. Quartz tube (Quartz Sci inc.) of 1 inch diameter was primarily used as reaction chamber. A mechanical pump was connected to maintain the low pressure environment inside the chamber. The length of uniform heating zone is 6 inches, with cooling zone extending outward. Carriers gas argon (Ar) and reactant gas oxygen (\ce{O2}) was regulated by two mass flow controllers respectively.

Silicon and silicon dioxides on Si wafer ($p$-Si(100),Unversity Wafer inc.) were primarily used as receiving substrates, and other substrates (i.e. Mica\footnote{ \ce{K(Al2)(Si3Al)O10(OH)2}}, glass (Fisher Scientific, microscope slide, 12-549),\footnote{Typical composition is 72.6\% \ce{SiO2}, 0.8\% \ce{B2O3}, 1.7\% \ce{Al2O3}, 4.6\% \ce{CaO}, 3.6\% \ce{MgO} and 15.2\% \ce{Na2O}} stainless steel) were occasionally adapted. The preparation procedure was illustrated in Fig. Substrates were first cut into rectangular pieces of certain size and then ultrasonically bathed (Branson 1510R-MTH) with acetone and alcohol for about 15 minutes each followed by blow-drying with nitrogen gas. After solution cleaning, the Si surface is hydrophobic. Depending on the specific experimental requirement, sometimes a hydrophilic surface is desired. We use plasma cleaning (Kurt J Lesker: Plasma-Preen 862) under 2Torr \ce{O2} for 3 minutes to render a hydrophilic Si surface. In addition, substrates can be coated with a thin layer of metal before sent into reaction chamber. This process details will be covered later in the \emph{Characterization} session. The controllable parameters of our CVD system includes central heating temperature, absolute gas flow and relative ratio of (Ar/\ce{O2}), amount of source material and the location of receiving substrates. The operation capability was summarized in Table.~\ref{tab:cvd}.

The substrates were mostly positioned in downstream cooling zone since within this region, the vapor undergoes a rapid temperature gradient and precipitation occurs. The source material placed in the central heating zone is oxidized and then evaporated. The growth species, transported by carrier gas, bombard both substrate and chamber wall. Some will be adsorbed by the substrate and become adatoms while some may remain as gas molecules, waiting for another event. On the hot substrate, adatoms diffuse and do not settle down until finding a appropriate location where equilibrium is favorable.

Nucleation is a process of generating a new phase from a metastable old phase, where the Gibbs energy per molecule of the bulk of the emerging new phase is less than that of the old phase.

\textbf{Magneton Sputtering} Sputtering, a process in which atoms are ejected from a solid target material by bombarding it with energetic particles, is a well established PVD process with a high degree of controllability. The high energy and controllable parameters of sputtering can result in the growth of well-structured and crystalline films. Further, sputtering can be easily implemented as a roll-to-roll process for large-scale manufacturing. It is widely utilized for deposition of \ce{WO_x} in industry.

Sputtering is a better PVD technique than e-beam deposition since it alleviates the adverse effects in the latter. \ce{Ar+} ions are accelerated to target foils. The pressure of \ce{Ar+} has two functions: to sputter off the target ions, and to influence the mean free path. These collisions between target ions and \ce{Ar+} leads to almost all arrival angle, thus uniform coverage. The sputter yield is No of target ions released per ions hitting on target. If \ce{Ar+} ion energy is less than 100eV, the yield is zero; If larger than 10 keV, implantation of \ce{Ar+} into target foils occurs. Usually yield between 1 and 2 is desired.

The MFP in sputtering is on order of 3 cm (assuming pressure 30mTorr), with source-to-substrate distance as 5cm, average No of collisions is about 5/3$\sim$2. 



The morphology and composition of the as-synthesized samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM,JEOL JSM-6480) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS,Oxford Instrument INCA). Crystal structures were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANXpert X’pert Pro MRD with Cu $K\alpha$ radiation at $\lambda$=1.5418\AA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100 \ce{LaB6} operated at 200kV). Optical measurements were performed by Micro-Raman spectroscopy (Horiba Scientific, Labram HR800 with 532 nm excitation laser) in a confocal microscope backscattering configuration with spectral resolution about 1 cm$^{-1}$. Optical absorption spectra was recorded using UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer(Schimadzu, UV2600Plus) in transmission mode. When necessary, the as-synthesized sample was removed from substrates by light sonication(Branson 1510R-MTH, 70W) in ethanol for 15 seconds. The dispersion was left for 12 hrs to enable the possible sedimentation, after which became transparent under the unaided eye. Then the dispersion was transferred into one 10 mm quartz cuvette (Thorlabs, W005654) for absorption measurement with another paired cuvette containing ethanol only.
